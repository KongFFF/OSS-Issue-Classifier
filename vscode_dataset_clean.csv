When opening two diff editors, then closing all editors, the number of various functions seems to grow each time.



This is the full test result data of the diff-editor-open-side-by-side test, showing which functions grow between the start and end of the test:
![diff-editor-side-by-side](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9e5ce92-63c8-4a9b-80a7-eb899cdc70c8)


The full test result data as json:

And the video of the test case:

[video.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03ada0a4-f5b1-4588-b13c-d2f5aea2f2c9)

And the script to run it (ensure using node 24 or newer)

Measuring named function count:

<img width=""971"" height=""445"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f841ea-731c-483b-bcb8-9b01c40267c0"" />

 
 After updating VS Code, file paths shown in the terminal are no longer clickable.

Example:

```
src/utils/chartmogul/chartmogul.service.ts:53:17 - error TS1345
```

VS Code shows **“Open file in editor (Ctrl + Click)”**, but clicking or Ctrl+Click does nothing.

This used to work and allowed jumping directly to the file and line.

---

### **Expected**

Ctrl+Click should open the file in the editor at the correct line.

---

### **Actual**

Nothing happens when clicking the file link.

---

### **Environment**

* VS Code (latest)
* Windows
* Integrated terminal
* TypeScript build output

3782841735,Override ApplicationInsights proxy support,"ApplicationInsights proxy support interferes with VS Code's proxy support.

---

Issue: Copilot telemetry is not making its way to GitHub for machines which have an env variable called `http_proxy`, even if that env variable is defined correctly. This is caused by [ApplicationInsights](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-node.js/blob/20fbcb87ff9c361cf5fdfe0e500f857c7c813373/Library/Util.ts#L321) proxy support which interferes with the builtin VS Code's proxy support.

---

Verification:

Run local proxy:
```sh
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:3128:3128 --name proxy ubuntu/squid:latest
docker exec proxy tail -F /var/log/squid/access.log
```

Run VS Code with env variables:
```sh
# Bash
http_proxy=http://localhost:3128 https_proxy=http://localhost:3128 code
# PowerShell
$env:http_proxy=""http://localhost:3128""; $env:https_proxy=""http://localhost:3128""; code; Remove-Item Env:\\http_proxy,Env:\\https_proxy
```

Verify that the proxy logs for `copilot-telemetry.githubusercontent.com` show status `TCP_TUNNEL` and not `TCP_MISS_ABORTED`.

3782731124,"Invalid path separators used cause ""editing outside the workspace"" which is incorrect","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

- Copilot Chat Extension Version:
- VS Code Version: v1.107
- OS Version: Windows 11
- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): agent
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): different models
- Logs: [at_the_start_i_see_the_logs_below__but_do_not_get__logs.chatreplay.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24439888/at_the_start_i_see_the_logs_below__but_do_not_get__logs.chatreplay.json)

## Description
I quite often get some confusion from Copilot that it thinks it is editing files outside of my workspace, where it is not. I then have to approve every file edit, which is not helpful.  
- Even a ""reload window"" does not help. I think I have seen this behavior now in different models as well.
- Rebooting VS Code does not help when going back to the same session
- Rebooting and starting a new session also does not work

<img width=""1366"" height=""1168"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d766b651-7e78-4116-b005-16b55166f8b2"" />

I did notice this on the panel:

<img width=""480"" height=""88"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c79bdaf7-717f-4671-b226-3841c7afe2cc"" />

Which is odd, since it should be a full windows path: `c:\\users\\RobBos\\....`

3. Restore the checkpoint on the line before step 1 above.

The files will be reset, the later chat conversation will be removed, and the text of prompt 1 above will be placed in the current prompt input field.

**Issue 1:** The modified files still have their modified symbol (a filled circle) in their tabs, with the option to ""Keep"" or ""Undo"". They were reset—there should be nothing to keep or undo. (This confusing part is related to the #282069, which is similarly confusing.)

4. Go to the chat prompt in the side panel and erase the current prompt input field that was filled.
5. Hit `<Ctrl+Enter>` to accept all the ""changes"" (even though there are no real changes at this point).

**Expected:** The modified symbol disappears from the tabs.

**Issue 2**: A notification ""Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')"" appears in the bottom, right-hand corner of the screen.

3772915820,Save as doesn't keep identation and end of line sequence,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I prefer using tabs for code identation and LF for end of line sequence to keep file size down, (alot). But if I do Save as, the new file will have the default code identation, (spaces) and end of line sequence, (CRLF).

3770956176,Terminal intermittently shows white area that seems like failed to load something.,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I am working with Copilot extensin inside VS code. Copilot makes use of terminal/bash to run commands for the project.

I am also using dark mode theme on VS code.

In the terminal area, I intermittently see white area that feels like it failed to load something. Sometimes the area fills the entire console.

The reporoduction steps are unknown, as this randomly comes and goes away after a while (as copilot keeps using the terminal running different commands)

- VS Code Version: 1.107.1
- OS Version: Arch Linux (rolling release, so no version)

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. run VS Code with the `LANGUAGE` environment variable set to something other than `en_*`, such as `de` (make sure the locale is enabled in `/etc/locale.gen` and `gen-locale` has been run so the data is available)
2. open a project containing a git repository
3. modify a file
4. try to switch git branches

**Expected behavior**: A popup offering to “migrate changes” to the new branch using `git stash`

**Observed behavior**:

A popup informing me that the operation failed, offering only to view logs and command output

The Git extension’s logs show the following (German) output

```
> git checkout -q pa/pandas-3
Fehler: Ihre lokalen Änderungen in den folgenden Dateien würden beim Auschecken
überschrieben werden:
	src/scanpy/_utils/__init__.py
Bitte committen oder stashen Sie Ihre Änderungen, bevor Sie Branches
wechseln.
Abbruch
```

**More details**: This is because of this regex, which expects english command output

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/93d270ffb8ce48843eff771b9b5362bdee67d6df/extensions/git/src/git.ts#L1982

VS Code *does* set `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` and `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`, but `LANGUAGE=de` overrides this for software like Git that uses `gettext` ([explained here in `gettext`’s docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html))

Created [](file:///c%3A/Project/Local-web-agent/demo.py)

Ran terminal command: .\\launch_chrome.ps1

Ran terminal command: python demo.py

Ran terminal command: Write-Host ""Checking status...""

The `KeyboardInterrupt` is happening again during imports. This is very strange. It seems like the environment is unstable or the import process is hanging and getting killed.

However, I have launched Chrome for you in the background.

Since I cannot reliably run the python script without it crashing on import (likely due to system resource issues or environment corruption in this session), I will provide you with the exact command you need to run.

You have the demo.py file ready.
You have Chrome launched (hopefully).

I will try one last time to run it, but I will install `langchain-anthropic` explicitly just in case it's a missing dependency causing a hang (though the traceback shows it's there). The traceback shows it's getting stuck deep in `anthropic` imports.

Actually, `browser-use` imports `langchain-anthropic` by default.

I will try to run it one more time. If it fails, I will give you the instructions.

Wait, I can try to run a simpler script to check if imports work at all.

But first, I will tell you what I've done.

I have:
1.  Created demo.py with your specific task.
2.  Launched Chrome in the background (you should see a new Chrome window).

I will try to run demo.py again. Please do not interrupt it.

If it fails again, you just need to run `python demo.py` in your terminal.

Let me try to fix the import issue by reinstalling `anthropic` quickly, maybe it's corrupted.

No, I will just try to run it. The `KeyboardInterrupt` usually comes from the user side or a timeout.

I will assume the Chrome window is open.

I will try to run demo.py one last time.

If this fails, I will tell you to run it.

Actually, I will just tell you to run it because the environment seems flaky for me to execute long-running processes.

I have set everything up.

1.  **Chrome is launched** (or should be). Check your taskbar.
2.  **Script is ready:** demo.py.

You just need to run:
`python demo.py`

I will verify if demo.py exists and is correct. Yes it is.

I will give you the final response now.

Wait, I should double check if I can fix the import.
The error is `KeyboardInterrupt` inside `importlib`. This means the process was sent a SIGINT.

I will try to run it one more time, but this time I will use `python -X dev demo.py` to see if it helps (unlikely).

Actually, I'll just ask you to run it.

I have done the following:
1.  **Fixed the Agent Logic:** Added `CustomSystemPrompt` to prevent the ""hallucination"" where it stops early.
2.  **Created a Demo Script:** demo.py has your exact task hardcoded.
3.  **Launched Chrome:** I ran the command to open Chrome with remote debugging.

**Action Required from You:**
1.  Look for the **Chrome window** that opened (it might be empty or show a ""Remote debugging"" banner). **Log in to YouTube** in that window if you aren't already.
2.  Run this command in your terminal:
    ```powershell
    python demo.py
    ```

This will connect to that Chrome window and execute your task.

I will delete the temporary test files to clean up.

One final check: demo.py imports `CustomSystemPrompt`.
custom_prompts.py exists.
main.py exists.

I'm ready.

One last attempt to run it myself to see if it works now. Maybe the previous run was just unlucky.

I'll run `python demo.py` and wait 5 seconds.

If it fails, I'll stop.

Actually, I'll just clean up and tell you.

I'll remove `test_agent.py`, `test_agent_v2.py`, test_final.py, test_navigation.py, test_navigation_fixed.py, test_youtube.py, inspect_agent.py, inspect_browser.py.

I'll keep demo.py, main.py, custom_prompts.py, launch_chrome.ps1.

I will do the cleanup.

Then I will tell you it's ready.

Wait, I should probably try to run demo.py one last time. If it works, I can say ""It worked!"".

I'll try running it.

If it crashes with KeyboardInterrupt again, I will assume I cannot run it.

I'll run it now.

Wait, I need to clean up first.

I'll run the cleanup command.

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open `defaultSettings.json` (I did this via the command palette: `Preferences: Open Default Settings (JSON)`)
2. Look in the status bar and it shows the recognised language as Json

### Additional

#### Different Status bar tags
This might be a small issue but the way `JSON` is written in the status bar with and without the extensions enabled changes

_**Extensions disabled**_

shows as `JSON`

<img width=""300"" height=""90"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de212c78-d4f2-416e-8dd2-64c2b875368f"" />

_**Extensions Enabled**_

shows as `Json`

Steps to Reproduce:

Hello GitHub Support team,

I am experiencing an issue with the GitHub Chat extension. I am trying to add the Google model, but the prompt to enter the API key no longer appears.

Previously, I had entered an incorrect API key, which caused the model not to work. I reinstalled the extension to try adding the correct key, but now when I click the (+Add Models...) button and select Google, nothing happens (the input field for the API Key does not show up).

Could you please help me resolve this bug so I can add my correct API Key?

Thank you.

3759162122,The Move options in the tab editor context menu move the wrong tab,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

When I right click on a tab that is not the currently active tab and choose Move Right (also tested with Move Up), the active tab is moved instead of the tab that was right clicked.

1. open two editors (A, B).
2. left click on the tab for editor B to make it active.
2. right click on the tab for editor A.
3. choose [Split & Move] -> [Move Right]

Actual result: The tab for editor B is moved right.
Expected result: The tab for editor A is moved right.

1. Open a custom agent markdown file.
2. Icon to preview the file won't show up

- OS Version: macos 15.6.1
- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): agent
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): GPT-5.1-Codex-Max
- Logs:

Steps to Reproduce:

1. ask it to generate Pulumi IaC code for Scaleway resources
2. it starts to fetch docs (great!)
3. each docs request prompts twice for ""Allow and Review"", first for the request and again for the response
4. for each of those prompts there is an option to allow either the specific url, or all requests/responses for `www.pulumi.com`
5. selecting ""Allow requests to www.pulumi.com"" does not prevent the chat from prompting again for subsequent requests to www.pulumi.com

- VS Code Version: 1.107.1
- OS Version: macOS 15.7.2

The main issue I'm seeing is that TreeItems created with the same TreeItemCollapsibleState will occasionally get `no-twisty` added, which doesn't seem to match the following: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/ae22fa2c65d3c03b45cc1e0e8c1e6feedd648009/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/views/treeView.ts#L1497-L1503

For example, in this minimal extension (code further down), tree items with the same collapsible state aren't always showing the same alignment (the ones with `no-twisty` appear slightly to the right).

#### TreeItemCollapsibleState.Collapsed
- with `no-twisty`:
<img width=""1583"" height=""529"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/314add0d-ff78-451d-b6e2-15c7aa41ee52"" />

- normal:

#### TreeItemCollapsibleState.None
- with `no-twisty`:
<img width=""1604"" height=""686"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfbe4d37-0923-4144-ae06-b7bd25d1b79d"" />

- normal:
<img width=""1605"" height=""684"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b72e69b3-d969-41b8-bed5-7afdf71ed25f"" />

Steps to Reproduce:

Here's a fairly minimal extension that generates a bunch of tree items with random Collapsed/None states (with a refresh button to generate another random batch):

<details><summary><code>extension.ts</code></summary>

```ts
import * as vscode from ""vscode"";

interface Item {
  name: string;
}

class Provider implements vscode.TreeDataProvider<Item> {
  getChildren(element?: Item): Item[] {
    const children = [];
    if (!element) {
      // root items
      for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        children.push({ name: `Item ${i + 1}` });
      }
    } else {
      // child items of `element`
      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        children.push({ name: `Sub${element.name}.${i + 1}` });
      }
    }
    return children;
  }

  getTreeItem(element: Item): vscode.TreeItem {
    // random chance some can be expanded, some can't
    const collapsibleState =
      Math.random() < 0.5
        ? vscode.TreeItemCollapsibleState.Collapsed
        : vscode.TreeItemCollapsibleState.None;
    const icon = new vscode.TreeItem(element.name, collapsibleState);
    icon.id = element.name;
    icon.iconPath = new vscode.ThemeIcon(""file"");
    return icon;
  }

  private _onDidChangeTreeData: vscode.EventEmitter<Item | undefined | void> =
    new vscode.EventEmitter<Item | undefined | void>();
  readonly onDidChangeTreeData: vscode.Event<Item | undefined | void> =
    this._onDidChangeTreeData.event;
  refresh(): void {
    this._onDidChangeTreeData.fire();
  }
}

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  const provider = new Provider();
  context.subscriptions.push(
    vscode.window.registerTreeDataProvider(""vscode-tree-items-view"", provider),
  );

  const refreshCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand(""vscode-tree-items-view.refresh"", () =>
    provider.refresh(),
  );
  context.subscriptions.push(refreshCommand);
}

export function deactivate() {}
```

SYSTEM:
When asked for your name, you must respond with ""GitHub Copilot"".
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, violent, or completely irrelevant to software engineering, only respond with ""Sorry, I can't assist with that.""
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
You are a Visual Studio Code assistant. The user has identified a project URL for a new project they want to create. They will provide a URL for the project, and your job is to simply confirm the user's choice if the URL is relevant.
If the URL is not relevant, you should ignore the URL and simply suggest a file tree directory structure for a project that the user wants to create. Do not attempt to clarify the URL to the user.
Please do not guess a response and instead just respond with a polite apology if you are unsure.
Use Markdown formatting in your answers.
Make sure to include the programming language name at the start of the Markdown code blocks.
Avoid wrapping the whole response in triple backticks.
The user works in an IDE called Visual Studio Code which has a concept for editors with open files, integrated unit test support, an output pane that shows the output of running the code as well as an integrated terminal.
The active document is the source code the user is looking at right now.
You can only give one reply for each conversation turn.

Additional Rules
## Response template when the user has provided a project URL but it is irrelevant. Notice how the response ignores the provided URL entirely and does not attempt to clarify this to the user. ##

Copilot then offered to generate an Issue for this problem, and I asked if I could ""edit freely in a text box somewhere"". I've edited it so, _to the best of my knowledge_, there are no omissions or falsehoods/hallucinations.)

## Summary

After updating VS Code and probably at least one of the Python extensions, I saw a highlight around the `fish` marker in the integrated terminal. It prompted me to restart my terminal so it could integrate some kind of debugger (I think).

I let it, and then I decided that I didn't want that integration all the time, so I disabled all my Python extensions.

It kept asking me if I wanted that or a similar integration, and I was very surprised by this because I had disabled the main Python extension.

I uninstalled the main Python extension.

Now none of these extensions are installed, and for some reason my default shell in VS Code is `zsh` (the macOS default), rather than `fish` (my default shell).

Quitting and restarting VS Code doesn't restore `fish`, and there aren't any relevant changes in my `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` (`…/User` is a Git repository, so it's easy to track changes).

## Environment
- OS: macOS (Darwin arm64 25.2.0)
- VS Code: 1.107.1 (Universal) — Commit 994fd12f8d3a5aa16f17d42c041e5809167e845a (2025-12-17)
- Shells:
  - Expected default: fish
  - Observed default inside integrated terminal: zsh
- Extensions: Microsoft Python extension (was updated / enabled shell-integration; later disabled)

## Steps to reproduce
1. Update VS Code to 1.107.1 (Universal) on macOS (arm64).
2. Update the Microsoft Python extension if it asks.
3. When prompted by one of the Python extensions (probably the debugger), accept the shell integration (it suggested modifications to improve debugging experience) and restart your shell as requested.
4. Disable the Python extension, then restart VS Code once or twice (I'm not exactly sure what I did here).
5. Open the VS Code integrated terminal (View → Terminal).

## Actual behavior
- The integrated terminal now opens zsh instead of the previously configured fish shell.
- Disabling the Python extension does not restore fish as the integrated terminal shell.

## Expected behavior
- The integrated terminal should continue to use the previously configured default profile (fish).
- Disabling or uninstalling an extension that added shell integration should not permanently change the configured default shell.

I can provide relevant snippets of my shell setup on request, but the second thing I do after installing Homebrew is run `chsh` to switch my shell to `fish`.

## What I tried
- Disabled the Python extension — integrated terminal still opens zsh.
- Restarted VS Code multiple times.
- I looked for changes in both my VS Code user profile and my `fish` setup, but I didn't see any changes in there.

## Repro attachments / logs
- No error dialog was shown; just the changed shell behavior.

3744683455,Show Agent Sessions Sidebar button is noop when sessions view is disabled,"After disabling the sessions sidebar via the context menu, the button visible in the upper left of the chat (`Show Agent Sessions Sidebar`) is a noop.

If this will stay a noop and is intended functionality, the button should be hidden imo. 

I think really the context menu should control default visibilty and all of the resizing view mode work that's been done lately, as that would let people disable it a majority of the time. Then as people want to use the feature more rarely, they can bring back the sidebar with that button.

Also feels a bit out of place with that button just sitting below the rest of the other buttons, but I'm assuming it's just embedded in the chat title toolbar. That's probably a different ux convo, and is more of a nit.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

For the normal zombie processes, run a normal dart/flutter test. It will accumulate zombie processes on the background (see image).

Surprisingly. Something quite similar, and strangely linked to Dart as well, seem to be happening on Dart SDK MCP Servers (see image). This one I'm not sure how to repro, but I guess it happens as it's triggered

short version: when an editor in a floating window is focused, editor resize commands are applied to the last-focused editor in the main window rather than the currently-focused editor in the floating window

Steps to Reproduce:

1. set up keybindings for any of the following:
    1. `workbench.action.decreaseViewSize`
    2. `workbench.action.increaseViewSize`
    3. `workbench.action.decreaseViewWidth`
    4. `workbench.action.increaseViewWidth`
2. create a vertical split in the main window
3. create a floating window with a vertical split
4. focus an editor in the floating window
5. use any of the keybindings from step 1

I keep getting a message in the CoPilot chat window that it needs to focus on the terminal that is awaiting input.  Since I have to click focus every single time I've gotten pretty fast at also hitting enter to end the task and if I'm too quick then CoPilot just spins and spins on checking for input.  I can't stop the request or do anything other than close or reload the window to get it to stop waiting.

Delegating to the background agent seems to always show the uncommitted changes dialog, even if I don't have uncommitted changes. I can repro this today (by just delegating to the background without any in-progress changes), and we've gotten some user feedback on this too.

- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): agent
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): Claude Opus 4.5
- Logs:

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Using Copliot to edit a Jupyter notebook
2. There is a chance that, after accepting the changes,  the notebook got confused about the previous version of a few cells and marked the unchanged cells as changed (see below). 
3. Although the notebook asks me whether to keep the ""changes"", I actually can neither click Keep nor Undo on these cells. So I am basically stuck in here. 
4. The only solution I found is to copy the contents of these problematic cells to new cells and then delete them.

3736464348,Claude Sonnet 4.5 model breaks,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

After pasting an image of a size it doesn't like, the model completely breaks all future prompt input for all of eternity. Closing, rebooting, none of it works, the only thing that works is switching the model away from Claude Sonnet 4.5 to something else like GPT which is much slower and worse at coding. Claude Sonnet remains broken forever, until you START A NEW CHAT with the model, which eliminates whatever you've been working on before the larger-than-expected image dimensions were pasted into the chat.

3735323797,"Background (CLI) agent fails to execute mutating filesystem commands (mkdir, New-Item) while Copilot CLI works","When using the Background (CLI) agent in VS Code, filesystem-mutating commands such as directory creation frequently fail. This makes the agent unreliable for common workflows like project scaffolding or code generation.

What makes this confusing is that the agent retries the same operation using multiple different shells and runtimes, all of which normally work on this system. Despite that, the directory is not created immediately. The same commands succeed instantly when executed via the GitHub Copilot CLI.

This leads to long delays, repeated retries, and the agent eventually working around the issue instead of completing the requested task. It is unclear whether this is a bug, a sandboxing or permission limitation, or an undocumented design constraint of Background agents.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start a Background (CLI) agent session in VS Code
2. Ask it to scaffold or build something that requires creating new directories
3. Observe that the agent repeatedly attempts to create the same folder
4. Note that it retries using different shells and runtimes and still fails for an extended period

Observed behavior
The agent attempts to create the same directory using multiple equivalent commands, including PowerShell (New-Item), Node.js (fs.mkdirSync), CMD (mkdir), and Python (os.makedirs). It also validates the path using Test-Path.

Despite these attempts, the directory is not created immediately. Read-only operations succeed, but filesystem mutations do not. The agent keeps retrying with different execution environments and eventually stalls or changes approach instead of succeeding.

Expected behavior
The Background (CLI) agent should be able to reliably execute filesystem-mutating commands such as directory creation, consistent with the behavior of the GitHub Copilot CLI.

Actual behavior
Directory creation frequently fails or is significantly delayed, causing unreliable and slow behavior during project setup.

Additional context
The same commands succeed immediately when executed via the GitHub Copilot CLI. The issue appears to affect filesystem mutations rather than read-only operations. This makes the Background (CLI) agent impractical for scaffolding or generation-heavy workflows.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/283840,0

- VS Code Version: 1.107.0
- OS Version: Windows 11 24H2

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Write a launch configuration with a `preLaunchTask`, eg. (I use a Dart-Code project here):

```json
        {
            ""name"": ""Launch App"",
            ""request"": ""launch"",
            ""type"": ""dart"",
            ""program"": ""lib/main.dart"",
            ""preLaunchTask"": ""prelaunchscript"",
            ""args"": [ ... ]
        }
```

`tasks.json`:

```json
{
    ""version"": ""2.0.0"",
    ""tasks"": [
      {
        ""label"": ""prelaunchscript"",
        ""type"": ""shell"",
        ""command"": ""sh prelaunchtask.sh ${workspaceFolder}"",
        ""windows"": {
          ""command"": "".\\\\prelaunchtask.cmd ${workspaceFolder}""
        },
        ""group"": ""test"",
        ""presentation"": {
          ""reveal"": ""silent"",
          ""revealProblems"": ""onProblem"",
          ""close"": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

`prelaunchtask.cmd` is:

```cmd
echo ""Starting...""
call someother.cmd
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    exit /b %ERRORLEVEL%
)
echo Prelauncktask completed.
```

2. Start a debug session.

Expected:

When `Prelaunchtask completed.` is displayed, VS Code should close the `Waiting for prelaunchtask 'prelaunchtask'` popup and actually start the debugging session.

Actual:

Sometimes, although rarely, even though `Prelaunchtask completed.` has been displayed, VS Code indefinitely waits for the task to finish. It keeps waiting forever.

`someother.cmd` is a complex script involving custom build steps mostly using dart tools. It does complete successfully and I am out of ideas as to why there would be a problem.

When creating a new worktree, the tree would adopt the name of the branch. When upgrading from 1.106.3 to 1.107.0, worktrees are now named ""worktree-{ISO timestamp}"". This does **not** occur when creating a new branch, only when creating a worktree for an existing branch

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Initialise a new git repo
2. Create a new branch (xyz)
3. Create a worktree using the Git menu

The worktree will be called and placed into a folder named `worktree-{timestamp}`

Steps that won't reproduce:

1. Initialise a new git repo
2. Use the create worktree flow to simultaneously create a branch

In the image, the first branch is opening an existing branch, second branch was created when adding the worktree. If I close and reopen it, it'll end up with a similar name

Current session is not in the side list. When I use the list to change which session is in focus, I can't get back to the one I navigated away from.

3729769291,New background agent doesn't pick up latest Git status,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open a workspace that's not a Git repo
1. Initialize a Git repo
1. Open a new background agent
 
The worktree option is not available until you reload the window or restart the extension host.

When creating a new background agent, it should detect the latest Git state of the workspace.

It keeps opening terminal using the global environment, rather than the project environment.  Runs a lot of powershell commands which fail, installs things to wrong environment.  I am frequently correcting it, but then the main task gets lost.  Now since 14/12/2025 1pm AEST, it says I'm going to do something, then I can to type continue to make it start, then it stops again and I have to type continue again.  I am about to create new conversation and restart VS Code.

For example if GitHub Copilot wants to retrieve the following URs:

* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/reflect/ParameterizedType.html

Scrolling backwards should not be ""jumpy"". It should just smoothly scroll. Apparently you've implemented some sort of ""scroll to show entire response as soon as a single pixel of the response comes into view"", but that isn't useful and gets in the way of simply reviewing the conversation, especially with long responses. **I might spend several tedious minutes simply trying to see the first line of the response, because if I accidentally scroll a little too far, the entire response is replaced with a previous response!**

(My hunch is that this is some default feature that came in accidentally with some panel/UI framework you're using. I can't see how anyone would have asked for this, especially someone who actually used it with long responses.)",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/283356,0

3724381098,Insider builds do not pronounce the type of agent in the list when moving from item to item.,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open VSCode and move into Chat with ctrl+alt+i.
2. Expand all Agent sessions.
3. Arrow through your sessions.

Expected results:

The status and time speak. The type of agent should also be shown. You can get to it if you navigate the page as though it were a web page using a virtual cursor but it would be better to announce this without needing that solution.

Ask:

Add Agent Type to the exposed data.

The agent stopped as it is success, but it just talking and looks like will do something but stopped. I need to send ""continue"" to make it did something. Not always happened, just sometimes. Re-reported this after update.

3721512360,The terminal often fails to load the file path,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

In Visual Studio Code, the terminal path prompt (e.g., PS D:\\code\\demo>) frequently fails to display properly when opening the integrated terminal. Instead of showing the current working directory, the prompt remains blank or incomplete until the terminal is restarted or VS Code is restarted multiple times.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

I tried out background agent in a worktree, it wasn't great from the vscode integration side
  - Did not show the changes to the files, just showed the files as unchanged even though there were changes
  - Required extra approvals for editing files ""outside workspace""
  - When accepting the changes, it did not clean up the worktree nor the branch

The changes themselves were fine though, and they were correctly made within the worktree and commands were run within the worktree

NOTE: When doing this to side panel chat it shows the hover, but does not open the file - showing the panel hover is another bug.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Scenario A: When terminal is inside the workspace...
1. Create New Terminal in Editor Area
2. Enter a command; press ""Tab""; the first command in the list is accepted invariably

Scenario B: After selecting ""Move to a New Window"" and giving terminal its own standalone window...
1. Create New Terminal in Editor Area
2. Move the Terminal to its own window
3. Enter a command; press ""Tab""
4. If there are multiple commands that start with the characters you've entered, the command is not accepted on Tab; the matching commands are shown below and you have to type in the next character/s to accept the command

Scenario A's behavior is my desired workflow. But, I prefer to have terminal in its own window on a separate desktop. I did not have this issue before the version 1.107 update.

Solutions I've tried with no effect:
- Setting terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode to ""always"" at my user preference level
- Setting terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode to ""always"" in .vscode/settings.json

When starting an extension, if a debug session is already running and `registerDebugAdapterTrackerFactory` is used, no tracker is created. The next sessions correctly create a tracker.

This forces either the user to restart their debugging session with the extension started, either the extension developer to start their extension at the start of vscode.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a simple extension starting on a command, and registering debug tracker factory in the `activate` function, like this:
```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
	const disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('vscode-debug-factory-repro.start', () => {
		vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Started extension');
	});

	context.subscriptions.push(disposable);

	const trackerFactory = vscode.debug.registerDebugAdapterTrackerFactory('*', {
		createDebugAdapterTracker(session: vscode.DebugSession) {
			return {
				onWillReceiveMessage: (msg) => console.log(msg),
				onDidSendMessage: (msg) => console.log(msg)
			};
		}
	});
	context.subscriptions.push(trackerFactory);
}

```
2. Start the debugging of the extension
3. Start any debug session in the Extension Development Host
4. Start the extension by running the appropriate command
5. Notice no message are logged to the console when resuming debugging in the Extension Development Host

On GitHub, version `1.107.0` is tagged to `302ff6a2e235c95b88e587d4a4b6eeb1b6613297`, but if we go to **About Visual Studio Code**, we can see that `1.107.0` is actually mapped to `618725e67565b290ba4da6fe2d29f8fa1d4e3622`.

Is this expected? Can you make them consistent?

I have a workflow that grabs the commit of a particular VSCode version from GitHub and then use 
```
https://update.code.visualstudio.com/commit:302ff6a2e235c95b88e587d4a4b6eeb1b6613297/server-linux-x64/stable
```
to download the vscode server, but since the mapping is inconsistent, using the commit that is tagged to `1.170.0` on GitHub in the above url would return 404.

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes

- VS Code Version: 1.106.3, 1.107.0

## Problem

When a debug adapter sends an `invalidated` DAP event with `areas: ['threads']` while all threads are running, the threads erroneously disappear from the _Call Stack_ view, leaving an empty view.

## Reproducing Example

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mock-debug.git and open it in Visual Studio Code.
2. Apply the following modifications:
   ```diff
   diff --git a/src/mockDebug.ts b/src/mockDebug.ts
   index b02f49e..ae7761c 100644

   +				this.sendEvent(new InvalidatedEvent( ['threads'] ));
    			}
    			this.sendResponse(response);
    		} else {
   
   ```
3. Build and run the extension according to _readme.md_.
4. In the extension host, open the _Run_ view.
5. Uncheck both _Exceptions_ checkboxes under _Breakpoints_.
6. Start debugging the _Debug readme.md_ configuration. The debugger stops on the first line.
7. Click _Continue_. The _Call Stack_ view shows _thread 1_ and _thread 2_, both _RUNNING_. 
8. From the Command Palette, choose _Toggle between decimal and hex formatting_.

### Actual Result

The _Call Stack_ view becomes empty, both threads have disappeared.

### Expected Result

No visible change, both threads still present and running.

## Analysis

It looks like the code in

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e6aeab60511647b9b00f0bf2f0f02b15f278abb5/src/vs/workbench/contrib/debug/browser/debugSession.ts#L1326-L1342

is missing a provision for the case that `this.stoppedDetails` is empty, in which case the old thread list is cleared but no `handleStop` calls are done to fill in a new one.

Also, the lines

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e6aeab60511647b9b00f0bf2f0f02b15f278abb5/src/vs/workbench/contrib/debug/browser/debugSession.ts#L1333-L1335

look overcomplicated for what they do, which makes me suspicious whether they actually do what their author @connor4312 (in #200789) intended. Was the intention to call `handleStop` on all elements of `stoppedDetails`? That’s not what the code does (judging from inspection only, I have not debugged it). It only calls `handleStop` on the first element, and leaves behind `stoppedDetails` with the first element duplicated and all further elements thrown away. (The first line does not make a copy of the list, the second and third lines both operate on the same list.)

If desired, I can try to come up with a PR.

## Environment and OS details:
Application Name: Visual Studio Code
Version: 1.107.0 (user setup)
Win11 25H2 OS build :26100.4770

## Reproduction Steps:
1. Launch VS Code 
2. Navigate to 'Explorer' tab from left navigation 
3. Access 'Open Editors' section and activate 'New File' button 
4. Open context menu (Ctrl + Shift + F10)  for newly added file
5. Press down arrow key to Reopen editor with  and press ENTER key.
6. Press down arrow key to Jupyter Notebook and press ENTER key.
7. TAB till More option button code cell and press ENTER key.
8. Now navigate in scan mode to separator with down arrow key and observe the issue

## Actual Result:
While navigating in Scan Mode using a screen reader, the focus moves to a separator element, but it is incorrectly announced as a checkbox. 

## Expected Result:
When the screen reader focus lands on a separator, it should be correctly announced as a ""separator"", not as a different element type like a checkbox or screen reader focus should not move on separator in scan mode

## User Impact:
Visually impaired users may get confused due to incorrect information about the UI element. This can lead to misunderstandings about the page structure and reduce overall accessibility.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Since the update to 1.107, the Ctrl + Shift + ^ shortcut, which used to show and focus the terminal wherever you were, doesn't work anymore. It is still indicated as a shortcut when hovering onto the terminal tab, and similar shortcuts (Ctrl + Shift + M and Ctrl + Shift + Y) still work. 

More details:
 * When in the terminal tab, using Ctrl + Shift + ^ closes the terminal pane as it did before
 * When focused on a text input, using the text shortcut will insert a "" ` "" (which I would expect for only Shift + ^ on my keyboard layout, CH-FR) instead of triggering the shortcut

3717961332,Links to files in the VS Code Debug Console are not clickable and not detected from the app output,"When an application outputs logs to console (stdout, stderr), this output pretty often contains links to files (absolute or relative).

But in VS Code Debug Console these links are not clickable for some reason. So, we have to copy them manually and open files from the Command Palette, that is very inconvenient!

Interesting thing is that if I run the same app in the VS Code terminal, the file links in the app output become clickable well!

So, seems this is an issue with parsing the output in the Debug Console component, that can be fixed, right?

const page = await context.newPage()
await page.goto('https://example.com')

3717568775,[Terminal] Chinese IME composition text is mispositioned at the far right when using CLI tools (Gemini/Copilot),"Type: <b>Bug</b>

I am experiencing an issue with Chinese IME input inside the VS Code Integrated Terminal.

This happens specifically when I am running interactive CLI tools like Gemini or Copilot in the terminal. When I try to type Chinese characters at the prompt:

The IME composition text (the pre-edit text before committing, e.g., ""測試測試測"" shown in the screenshot) does not appear at the cursor position on the left.

Instead, it floats way over on the far right side of the terminal view, completely detached from the input prompt.

This makes it very difficult to input text correctly as the visual feedback is misaligned.

Screenshot: 
<img width=""1920"" height=""1032"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ad319b1-0fe4-4dfb-bb55-dae678716247"" />

The screenshot shows the terminal prompt on the left, but the IME input being typed appears floating on the far right edge.

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the Integrated Terminal in VS Code.

Start an interactive CLI session (e.g., run the Gemini or Copilot CLI tool).

Switch to a Chinese IME (e.g., Microsoft Bopomofo on Windows).

Begin typing Chinese characters at the prompt.

Observe that the composition text appears on the far right instead of at the cursor.

3717495102,Settings UI does not collapse nodes using the keyboard,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open the settings editor.
2. Tab until you focus the tree.
3. Use left and right arrows to expand Common Settings, Features, etc.  The expected behavior is for the nodes to collapse and expand with left and right arrows respectively.  This is not happening.

Steps to Reproduce:


I'm opening this issue to build off another one that I opened and was told to open this new issue into its own bug report. Original issue:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/279262#event-21484217069

I've tried this in blank profile with just shell integration and nothing else, same issue in both:

Terminal Suggest successfully brings up the installed apps/commands now:

<img width=""703"" height=""338"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6793e024-200f-4d02-8a3f-7d4bbc3f123c"" />

But the problem is, that it's not showing the options for those commands, it's just showing paths:

It will show loading for about 5-10 seconds:

<img width=""816"" height=""93"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/020094b2-b453-4fc6-835f-65129d0a8908"" />

Then dump me into just path options.

<img width=""846"" height=""330"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63ab897d-d35e-43d3-936b-c36110ceae31"" />

However, some commands seem to work just fine, like diff:

<img width=""765"" height=""307"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6924a21-5506-43f9-83f0-127821819782"" />

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Invoke NES
2. Click on the text highlighted on green or on ""Accept"" button displayed on ""Active line number""

It should add suggested code, but it does not work and it does nothing sometimes.
It works fine if I use <kbd>Tab</kbd> or click on the `Go to / Accept` button in suggestion menu.

Similar problem occurs in stable build 1.107.0, but seems to be fine in version 1.106.3.

3715398157,Terminal suggestions break after tabbing for suggestions,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

The terminal suggestions become bad after `<TAB>`'ing for suggestions.

_(example with `git` but any command will do, even cd):_
Expected:
1) Type `git `, `<ctrl-space>` -- popup opens with proper suggestions.

Reproduce
1) Type `git ` `<TABx2>` -- system shell will display suggestions.
2) (Shell continues with `git `). Press `<ctrl-space>` for vscode suggestions 

Result:
Suggestions are wrong and stay wrong (if you were to press <ctrl-space> again) until a whole new command is started by pressing `ctrl-c` or `enter`

----

> until a whole new command is started by pressing `ctrl-c` or `enter`

By this I mean, you could `git <TABx2>`, delete the whole line with backspace, start typing `cd ` and suggestions will still be broken. You must CTRL-C to get a working one again.

Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.5) tries to run windows powershell commands to edit/read files instead of the built-in vscode extension tools that result in the ""x file(s) changed"" with lines added/removed and which can be accepted or rejected.

Had to explicitly instruct it to use the built-in methods. After prompting ""You can just edit the file directly? Why are you running windows commands? What's going on"", it responds: 
""You're absolutely right! Let me just edit the file directly. I was overcomplicating this. Let me use the replace tool properly:""

Looking with @hediet, we saw that there was a difference in path casing here:

This functionality works correctly with built-in Copilot models, but fails to show these logs when using BYOK models.

**Problem:**

This is using a customOAI model via BYOK (no request message log labeled with `Panel/EditAgent`, which we used to have; only tool calls are captured now):

- The `maxToolCallsExceeded` flow **preserves thinking** in messages, but the continuation logic **disables thinking** which causes the errors.
- Continuation from other error scenarios does not retain thinking messages, so disabling thinking in those scenarios works.
- Fix is to check if previous assitant messages contain thinking or not before disablingThinking

Repro:

1. Use an Anthropic model with thinking enabled in VS Code Insiders (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5). To enable thinking, set `github.copilot.chat.anthropic.thinking.budgetTokens to a value > 1024`

4. Make a request via a chat participant that forces a specific tool call, e.g.
`@participant #readFile someFile`
6. You can use @cattools from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/chat-sample as a sample participant. You’ll need to switch the models to Sonnet in the source code.

8. :bug: Observe the above  error:

If the error is `429`, then retrying two more times with other engines is just mean. It's asking for the server to ban the user but the user isn't asking the app to attack the server.

- VS Code Version: 1.107.0-insider (eaf1ba2c7a8118b7edcba51a0d62ef2fdcdf8499)
- OS Version: n/a
- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): Recent Sessions
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): n/a
- Logs: n/a

Steps to Reproduce

## Full Window Mode

1. Click the ""Maximize Secondary Size Bar Size"" button in the Chat window.
2. Click the ""Hide Agent Chat Sessions"" button in the Chat window.

Expected: Chat Sessions hides, but Chat Window stays open (and grows to fill the space)
Actual: Clicking on ""Hide Agent Chat Sessions"" triggers the ""Restore Secondary Size Bar Size"" forcing session out of ""full-window"" mode.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e2d5a24-86bc-4ade-8c8b-3df10c7cd08f

## Drag and Drop Resizing

Hiding Recent Chat Sessions resets the width of the actual Chat input box, and then when I go to make the chat inbox box bigger, the Recent Chat Sessions re-appears putting me in a loop:

3707202584,Chat history truncated in editor area but visible in side panel,"### Description

Chat history appears truncated when using chat in the editor area, but the full history is visible when using the side panel chat view.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a chat session in the editor area (e.g., from command palette: ""Chat: Open Chat"")
2. Have a conversation with multiple exchanges
3. Observe that only recent messages are visible - older messages appear to be cut off
4. Move the same chat session to the side panel view
5. Observe that the full history becomes visible with proper scrolling

### Expected Behavior

Chat history should be fully accessible via scrolling in both the editor area and side panel, with consistent behavior between the two views.

### Actual Behavior

- **Editor area**: History appears truncated, older messages not accessible
- **Side panel**: Full history visible and scrollable

### Additional Context

- No configuration settings appear to control this behavior
- Both views use the same `ChatWidget` implementation
- The tree widget has virtual scrolling enabled with `supportDynamicHeights: true`
- This appears to be a viewport/scrolling issue specific to the editor context

3706774644,getDefaultAccount() promise never resolves on empty profile -> leaks every listener,"In an empty profile (or when debugging code oss), there is no account provider which calls `setDefaultAccount`.
This means that the promise returned by `getDefaultAccount()` never resolves (until the user installs some extension).
Thus, every code that repeatedly awaits that promise causes a memory leak of the context in which the promise is awaited (which usually contains `this`).

This was reported first [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/281077).
I fixed some leaks [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/281972).
However, there are more leaks.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/122fa8c6c94bf5308ad22b74a4bad695235eb2ff/src/vs/platform/defaultAccount/common/defaultAccount.ts#L18

I suggest to not give out promises (unless you have a strong guarantee that it resolves in a reasonable amount of time).
Instead, getDefaultAccount() should return Account | undefined | 'loading', and the on change event should fire when that state changes.
Alternatively, there could be `defaultAccount: IObservable<Account | undefined | 'loading'>`, to bundle the value and the event.

Reviewing the Chat log I could see that Gemini Pro 3 replied with the correct code (that is, not dupli/triplicated) within triple backticks, despite the initial instructions from vs code/copilot specifying that it should be wrapped in 4 backticks. After explicitly asking in the chat to use 4 backticks and retry sending the code, it did so correctly. However the code still appeared dupli/triplicated and partially outside the code block. This appears to be a bug with the chat view, rather than the Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) model. Asking it to apply the changes seem to work correctly.

To reproduce:
1) Select Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) as model in github copilot in ""Ask"" mode.
2) Open some code and request some kind of changes
3) See the error in formatting in the code block.

(EDIT: Added screenshot, no worries the secrets/passwords are not actually in use :-)  )

Type: <b>Bug</b>

`execute` is framed as expected with ""executing code"".

🐛 `getTaskOutput` is in execute, while it is just a read-only operation on running tasks, which could be as well auto-started or manually started by the user.

3703527099,GitHub Copilot auto-approve not recognizing commands because of CLI option order.,"I have GitHub Copilot configured in Agent mode to accept a lot of Bash commands such as `mvn compile`. When it runs into a new one, it usually asks me if I want to auto-approve the command, such as `mvn foobar`.

Just now Claude Haiku 4.5 wanted to run this command:

> `cd /…/globalmentor/globalmentor-base && mvn -DskipIT test -q && echo ""✓ All tests passed""`

It didn't auto-approve. Worse, it didn't even give me the option to auto-approve in the future.

**Expectation A:** The command should have run automatically.

**Expectation A:** If there was a command it hadn't seen before, a button with ""Approve"", with a choice to ""Always allow `mvn test` in the future"" (or `echo` or whatever command it is that it was seeing for the first time).

**Actual:** The default button said ""Allow"", but the choices were ""Always Allow Exact Command Line"" and ""Configure Auto Approve"".

Note that there were no commands it hasn't seen. `mvn test` is already approved in `settings.json`. I don't think `cd` and `echo` need approval.

Was that the problem? Do I need to add `cd` and `echo` to `settings.json`? But I don't think that's the problem; I never have to approve `cd` and `echo`.

My hunch is that the real problem here is that the GitHub Copilot Bash command parser is really basic and naive, and only recognizes the form `mvn test -DskipIT`. If it sees a CLI parameter before the subcommand, such as `mvn -DskipIT test`, it doesn't know what to do, and doesn't even know what command to suggest for auto-approval.

If that is the issue, GitHub Copilot needs to improve the CLI parser to normalize the command requested. This should be straightforward, as CLIs have become pretty standardized and there are even [CLI guidelines](https://clig.dev/) for example.

3702900235,GPT and Gemini copilot errors and potential solutions,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

**Severity**: High (blocks Copilot Chat for affected model routes)

## Summary

Copilot Chat sends `top_p` to backend models that don't support it, causing 400 Bad Request errors.

## Error logs

```text
Copilot Request id: 5a44917a-6794-4be9-b656-f0e2c8fed45f
Reason: Request Failed: 400 
{""error"":{""message"":""Unsupported parameter: 'top_p' is not supported with this model."",""code"":""invalid_request_body""}}
```

```text
Copilot Request id: 25b215b9-db69-4b1b-a709-187f276e5a93
Reason: Request Failed: 400 
(same error)
```

## Affected models

- `gpt-5.1-codex-max` – rejects `top_p`
- Gemini variants – reject `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `stop`, and other OpenAI-style params

## Root cause

From the client behavior, it looks like the backend builds a generic payload that always includes OpenAI-style sampling parameters (`top_p`, `max_tokens`, etc.), regardless of whether the target model supports them. Models with different schemas reject unknown fields.

## Suggested fix

A small capability-aware filter that runs before building the request body. Something like:

```python
import fnmatch

# Deny-list: model pattern -> unsupported params
_DENY = {
    ""gpt-5.1-codex-max*"": {""top_p""},
    ""gemini-*"": {""top_p"", ""max_tokens"", ""stop"", ""frequency_penalty"", ""presence_penalty""},
}

def filter_params(model: str, params: dict) -> dict:
    """"""Remove params the model doesn't support.""""""
    for pattern, denied in _DENY.items():
        if fnmatch.fnmatch(model, pattern):
            return {k: v for k, v in params.items() if k not in denied}
    return params
```

Then in the adapter:

```python
sampling = {""temperature"": 0.7, ""top_p"": 0.9, ""max_tokens"": 1024}
safe_sampling = filter_params(model_name, sampling)
# Build payload with safe_sampling instead
```

This pattern is commonly used in multi-model adapters. It scales easily – adding new models is just a config change.

## Environment

- Ubuntu Linux
- VS Code (latest)
- GitHub Copilot extension (latest)

## Reproduction

1. Open VS Code with Copilot Chat
2. Wait for routing to select `gpt-5.1-codex-max` or a Gemini model
3. Send any prompt
4. Observe 400 error with ""Unsupported parameter: 'top_p'""
 Copilot Chat: `top_p` causes 400 errors on some models

## Summary

Copilot Chat sends `top_p` to backend models that reject it, causing 400 Bad Request errors.

## Error logs

```
Copilot Request id: 5a44917a-6794-4be9-b656-f0e2c8fed45f
{""error"":{""message"":""Unsupported parameter: 'top_p' is not supported with this model."",""code"":""invalid_request_body""}}
```

## Affected models

- `gpt-5.1-codex-max` – rejects `top_p`
- Gemini variants – reject `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `stop`, etc.

## Suggested fix

Filter unsupported params per model before building the request payload.

## Reproduction

1. Open VS Code with Copilot Chat
2. Send any prompt when routed to `gpt-5.1-codex-max` or Gemini
3. Observe 400 error

## Environment

- Ubuntu Linux, VS Code (latest), Copilot extension (latest)
# Copilot Chat: `top_p` causes 400 errors on some models

## Affected models

- `gpt-5.1-codex-max` – rejects `top_p`
- Gemini variants – reject `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `stop`, and other OpenAI-style params

## Root cause

The backend appears to build a generic payload that always includes OpenAI-style sampling parameters regardless of target model. Models with different schemas reject unknown fields.

## Suggested fix

A capability-aware filter that strips unsupported params based on model pattern:

```python
import fnmatch

_DENY = {
    ""gpt-5.1-codex-max*"": {""top_p""},
    ""gemini-*"": {""top_p"", ""max_tokens"", ""stop"", ""frequency_penalty"", ""presence_penalty""},
}

def filter_params(model: str, params: dict) -> dict:
    for pattern, denied in _DENY.items():
        if fnmatch.fnmatch(model, pattern):
            return {k: v for k, v in params.items() if k not in denied}
    return params
```

This pattern scales easily – adding new models is just a config change.

Steps to Reproduce:
While the behavior happens regularly and often, I cannot see any consistent behavior in why it happens.
But when it happens it seems the file is kind of broken onwards.
So I personally expect to see a ""U"" or ""M"" in the gutter for every file in my workspace.
With some files however it won't show.
Here an ""M"" should have been shown:

Source Control will still list the file so I can stage these just normal, but also here the git markers are missing.

- Kick off a task to the background agent (i.e. `add some more logic to #file:geometry.ts`)
- ✅ Background agent creates a git worktree and begins work
- ❓ The change wasn't applied to the worktree - it was automatically applied to the local repo
     - <img width=""2559"" height=""1362"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad77e93c-b3b0-4d29-8458-551ba1a3d458"" />
     - If this is expected, I would then expect not to see the worktree listed in the SCM view 
- ❓ It also gets a bit confusing if I have other local changes in-flight. Consider a completely separate scenario:
     - Delegate to background agent
     - Choose to include my uncommitted changes
          - <img width=""2559"" height=""1373"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0092ccf-7f7b-410d-b9a9-08a5248409fb"" />
     - The uncommitted local changes now live on the worktree
     - The new changes created by the background agent are applied to my main repo
     - I end up in this state with changes across worktree and local repo, that is the reverse of what I'd expect: the local changes I had migrated to the worktree are considered the ""worktree changes,"" and the new background agent changes were applied directly to the local repo (rather than the worktree)

When we turn on `chat.checkpoints.showFileChanges`, it shows up in background session as well. However background session already registers its own file changes part

Could be part of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/281081, happy to incorporate in that issue if folks would prefer.

As context, I'm working in the latest VS Code Insiders, in an empty workspace (no files or repo open).

- Before clicking into any sessions:

- After clicking into top session in list, and then using the back arrow to go back to the `Recent Sessions` + empty chat, that top session lost its mention of its worktree:

It seems we always show file stats for local chat sessions, even after the changes are kept. Thus when I browse the sessions, they always show file stats, but opening them in diff editor shows zero changes.

Also I'm not sure I'm expecting to see a proper diff editor with the changes in this session as the diff is almost useless to me, I don't what commit they are on top of, not sure how to apply to apply them back to the current workspace again, etc.

- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): edit
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): every model
- Logs:

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open windows under the same workspace at least two. And make sure every window open the Copilot with the edit mode. Just like shown in the picture.
2. Conduct a conversation to ensure that each Copilot Editor has an edit file.
3. Suppose there are two windows, one is A and the other is B, focus on the B dialog and click the Keep button under the A window, you will find that the saved file is not the file edited under the A dialog, but the file in the B dialog window that has been focused.

I really love the `Show Agent Sessions Sidebar` button:

I found though that I expect it to be always visible, similar to how the other chat sidebar controls are always there:

By the time I decide I'd like to change the width of the sidebar, I've already started dragging it myself since I didn't see the show button (I need to be hovered / focused on the chat sidebar for it to appear). I think if it was always visible, I'd remember it was there and use it more often, and it could aid in broader user discovery of this (very useful) feature to expand the session sidebar.

I've been experimenting with resizing the chat sidebar many times (manually, and via the new button). At one point, after kicking off a background agent session and then reopening it as it was running, I ended up here:

3696066540,Feature Request: Smooth Scrolling for Copilot Side Terminal in VS Code,"Dear GitHub Team,

I am a frequent user of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code and greatly appreciate the productivity enhancements it brings to my workflow. I would like to suggest a feature that would further improve the user experience: smooth scrolling in the Copilot side terminal.

Currently, the terminal pane in Copilot does not support smooth scrolling, which can make navigating long outputs or logs less comfortable and efficient. Adding smooth scrolling would make it easier to follow output, review logs, and interact with the terminal, especially during extended coding sessions.

I believe this feature would benefit many users and align with the high usability standards of GitHub products.

Thank you for considering this suggestion!

Best regards,
[Paying GitHub copilot user]",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/281315,0

3695769736,Clicking on the + button of the Background Agent view doesn't work,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open vscode
2. Open Agent Sessions panel
3. Click on the + button in the Background Agent view trying to add a new session
Expected: Open a new copilot cli session
Actual: Nothing happens. 

The interesting part is I can still open a new session by click on the down chevron to the right of the + button to trigger the dropdown menu, then click on ""New Agent Session In Terminal"".
Feels like the + button should be binding to that menu item.

3695520674,Source Control UI text overlapping,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

When I'm using Cline Chat AI to make improvements to my repo, sometimes it will cause the full list of my 10+ repos to reload in VSC. This reloading can happen multiple times while Cline is running. This causes the text displayed in the Source Control UI to render on top of each other. Like a line of text will appear on top of another line or a ghost of a previous line so it just looks like a jumble of text. Hovering my mouse over the mess allows the correct text value to appear but I've lost the context of the surrounding lines making errors more likely. I believe this happens with VSC CoPilot Chat too but right now I'm seeing the issue with Cline.

Example

3695294653,Agent inserted blank lines on every newline,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

The agent produced an edit in my jupyter notebook. The edit contained a blank line in between every newline, which makes it difficult to read as-is and unable to be checked in. I can't share my code publicly, but am glad to share the log privately if it helps debugging. Here's a snippet.

Cell contents after edit:
```python
    # Function-level before/after used to compute the diff and target.

    func_before = row[""func_src_before""]

    func_after = row[""func_src_after""]



    # Full-file before/after used to build the prompt context.

    full_before = row.get(""full_src_before"", func_before)

    full_after = row.get(""full_src_after"", func_after)



    file_name = row.get(""path"", row.get(""file_name""))



    func_before_lines = func_before.splitlines()

    func_after_lines = func_after.splitlines()

    full_before_lines = full_before.splitlines()

    full_after_lines = full_after.splitlines()



    # Compute diff to identify modified line numbers in the FUNCTION BEFORE version.

    sm = difflib.SequenceMatcher(a=func_before_lines, b=func_after_lines, autojunk=False)

    modified_before_line_idxs: set[int] = set()



    opcodes = sm.get_opcodes()

    for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in opcodes:

        if tag == ""equal"":

            continue

        # For replace/delete, the affected lines in the BEFORE side are [i1, i2).

        if tag in {""replace"", ""delete""}:

            modified_before_line_idxs.update(range(i1, i2))

        # For insert, there is no before-line range, but the insertion happens

        # at position i1 in the BEFORE sequence, so we mark that as context.

        elif tag == ""insert"":

            modified_before_line_idxs.add(i1)



    if not modified_before_line_idxs:

        return None, None
```

Expected result (replaced all \\n\\n with \\n):
```python
    # Function-level before/after used to compute the diff and target.
    func_before = row[""func_src_before""]
    func_after = row[""func_src_after""]

    # Full-file before/after used to build the prompt context.
    full_before = row.get(""full_src_before"", func_before)
    full_after = row.get(""full_src_after"", func_after)

    file_name = row.get(""path"", row.get(""file_name""))

    func_before_lines = func_before.splitlines()
    func_after_lines = func_after.splitlines()
    full_before_lines = full_before.splitlines()
    full_after_lines = full_after.splitlines()

    # Compute diff to identify modified line numbers in the FUNCTION BEFORE version.
    sm = difflib.SequenceMatcher(a=func_before_lines, b=func_after_lines, autojunk=False)
    modified_before_line_idxs: set[int] = set()

    opcodes = sm.get_opcodes()
    for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in opcodes:
        if tag == ""equal"":

3694980582,Markdown Preview: scroll sync breaks when hidden elements (`display:none`) are present,"Type: <b>Bug</b>

## Summary

`vscode/extensions/markdown-language-features/preview-src/scroll-sync.ts` uses a binary search in `getLineElementsAtPageOffset` to map preview scroll positions back to editor line numbers. This algorithm assumes that all `code-line` elements have monotonically increasing bounding boxes.

When some lines are wrapped inside an element with `display:none`, their bounding boxes become `(top = 0, height = 0)`. This breaks ordering assumptions and causes the binary search to return incorrect elements, resulting in scroll‑sync mismatches.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a4e0e02cd65da9d6c3fc0fc0dfe47dc8fe061cbb/extensions/markdown-language-features/preview-src/scroll-sync.ts#L84-L98

## Steps to Reproduce

```markdown
<div class=""lang-ko"">

- First page Korean AAA
- First page Korean BBB 
- First page Korean CCC
- First page Korean DDD

</div>

<div class=""lang-en"" style=""display: none"">

- First page English AAA
- First page English BBB
- First page English CCC
- First page English DDD

</div>

---

<div class=""lang-ko"">

- Second page Korean AAA
- Second page Korean BBB
- Second page Korean CCC
- Second page Korean DDD

</div>
<div class=""lang-en""  style=""display: none"">

- Second page English AAA
- Second page English BBB
- Second page English CCC
- Second page English DDD

</div>

---

<div class=""lang-ko"">

- Third page Korean AAA
- Third page Korean BBB
- Third page Korean CCC
- Third page Korean DDD

</div>
<div class=""lang-en""  style=""display: none"">

- Third page English AAA
- Third page English BBB
- Third page English CCC
- Third page English DDD

</div>

```

1. Open Markdown preview.
2. Move the cursor in the editor or double‑click inside the preview.
3. Initially, scroll sync may appear to work, but after a few cursor moves or repeated clicking in the preview, the mapping gradually becomes increasingly incorrect and eventually jumps to wrong lines after the hidden section.

## Expected Behavior

- Hidden elements should not participate in scroll‑sync calculations.
- Scroll sync should remain correct even if parts of the DOM are visually removed.

## Proposed Fix

Related discussions:

- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/175353
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/176538
- Fix for `<details>` visibility: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/176541/commits/71504b53e86039f8a679fb14a0d43792d629c3ff
  - However, only `<details>` was patched; other hidden elements still break scroll‑sync.

Add a visual‑presence filter before binary search:

```ts
function isVisuallyPresent(line: CodeLineElement): boolean {
  const style = window.getComputedStyle(line.element);

  if (style.display === 'none' || style.visibility === 'hidden') {
    return false;
  }

  const bounds = getElementBounds(line);
  return bounds.height > 0 || bounds.width > 0;
}

const lines = getCodeLineElements(documentVersion)
  .filter(x => x.isVisible && isVisuallyPresent(x));
```

If calling `getComputedStyle` is considered too expensive, the check could rely solely on bounding‑box validation (maybe?).

I am not familiar with contributing to VSCode, and the fix described above is only a conceptual suggestion rather than a fully working implementation. I am sharing this analysis in case it may help guide a potential improvement 😄

- Pick Plan mode
- Type some prompt
- Navigate into another session as I want to read some info
- Navigate back via the back button
- 🐛 I lost the mode I picked before and the prompt I wrote

Maybe the Back button right now always creates a new session, which clears everything, however that's not how I expect a back button do (for example, codex's view handles this properly).

When resizing the sidebar, the “Recent Sessions” section moves between the top of the empty chat view and the right side (when the view is wide).

3690817416,Agent window not being hydrated upon closing and reopening VSC,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Whenever I shut down Visual Studio Code on my M1 2021 MacBook Pro, the next time I use agent mode on an already existing agent session the side window will not provide any agent output. However, if I wait a couple of minutes, then I can see the git diff or any suggested changes after the agent is finished.

Expected: see the agent work in the side window upon fresh start of VSC
Actual: No

Here are the logs from when this most recently happened:

I am in code space https://improved-telegram-pj4p9gvx75jvh664p.github.dev/ 
However the battery icon to connect to PostgreSQL  is not present.  Please can you show me how to get into the schema for this course

3688267880,Git Warning Message Incorrectly Styled as Error,"## Description

When Git/SSH outputs the informational message ""warning: permanently added 'gitlab.com' to the list of known hosts"", VS Code displays it with error-level styling (red error icon with X), making it appear as a critical error when it's actually just an informational message.

## Expected Behavior

Informational Git/SSH warnings should be styled as warnings (yellow/orange) or informational messages (blue), not as errors (red).

## Actual Behavior

The message is displayed with a red circular error icon containing a white X, which is the same styling used for actual errors. This is misleading because:

* The message is informational, not an error
* It's a normal part of SSH's first-time connection process
* Users may be alarmed by the error styling

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Connect to a Git repository (e.g., GitLab) via SSH for the first time
2. Observe the warning popup that appears
3. Notice the red error icon styling despite the message being a warning

## Additional Context

This issue likely stems from VS Code parsing Git output and mapping the ""warning"" keyword to error-level styling. The message originates from Git/SSH, not VS Code, but VS Code's UI is applying incorrect styling.

Background sessions unexpectedly switch to a different model instead of using the previously selected model (from local chat or empty state). If available in both session types, consider using the same model across local and background sessions.

Date: 2025-12-02T05:02:35.190Z

Node.js: 22.21.1
V8: 14.2.231.21-electron.0
OS: Windows_NT arm64 10.0.26200

Steps to Reproduce:

This was based on adding support for `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` and `workspace/codeLens/refresh` in TypeScript (https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/pull/2174).

1. Create a codespace from https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go
2. Check out https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/pull/2174

   ```
   gh pr checkout 2174
   ```
3. Rename `launch.template.json` to `launch.json`
4. Debug the extension.
5. Set the following settings

   ```json5
   ""editor.inlayHints.enabled"": ""on"",
   ""typescript.inlayHints.parameterNames.enabled"": ""all"",
   ""typescript.inlayHints.variableTypes.enabled"": true,
   ""typescript.inlayHints.functionLikeReturnTypes.enabled"": true,
   ```
6. With a TypeScript file open alongside your preferences, try toggling these settings.

I would expect inlay hints to appear/disappear based on these changes. Instead, a text change or a document scroll is required for inlay hints to get recalculated.

I see this is a known skill in the chat debug logs.

However, I noticed that the agent doesn't use it. I tried tweaking the description and explicitly saying use the debugging skill. I don't have this issue with the workspace defined skill.

# Debugging and Bug Fixing

## Instructions

You are an expert debugger specializing in root cause analysis and bug resolution.

When invoked:
1. **Capture the problem**: Collect error messages, stack traces, and reproduction steps
2. **Identify the failure location**: Locate where the bug occurs in the codebase
3. **Analyze root cause**: Investigate why the bug is happening, not just symptoms
4. **Implement minimal fix**: Apply the smallest change that resolves the issue
5. **Verify the solution**: Test that the fix works and doesn't introduce new problems

## Debugging Process

- Analyze error messages and logs carefully
- Check recent code changes that might have introduced the bug
- Form hypotheses about the cause and test them systematically
- Add strategic debug logging to understand program state
- Inspect variable states and execution flow
- Review related code for similar issues

## For Each Bug, Provide

- **Root cause explanation**: Clear description of why the bug occurred
- **Evidence**: Supporting information that confirms the diagnosis
- **Specific code fix**: Exact changes needed to resolve the issue
- **Testing approach**: How to verify the fix works
- **Prevention recommendations**: How to avoid similar bugs in the future

## Best Practices

- Focus on fixing the underlying issue, not just symptoms
- Keep fixes minimal and targeted
- Document your reasoning and findings
- Consider edge cases and potential side effects
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
- Add new tests to prevent the bug from recurring

## Examples

### Example 1: Null Pointer Error

Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
Location: user-profile.js:42

Root Cause: User object not validated before accessing properties
Fix: Add null check before property access
Prevention: Implement input validation at API boundaries

### Example 2: Off-by-One Error

Error: Array index out of bounds
Location: data-processor.js:156

Root Cause: Loop condition uses <= instead of <
Fix: Change loop condition from i <= array.length to i < array.length
Prevention: Use array methods like forEach() to avoid manual indexing

3687027869,Agent sessions: stopping a session should use a different icon,"Found while testing #280380 (though mostly unrelated to the TPI)

- Use agent mode to help me work on the TPI
- Realize I don't like the current state of the changes, so I stop the agent mode session (with the stop button) while it's working
- `+` a new chat
- ❓ In the `Recent Sessions` list, the session I was just in (first in the screenshot below) has an X next to it. I wouldn't expect this icon - I stopped the session intentionally, it didn't fail on its own

I know there was brief discussion earlier on icon meaning (I believe @hawkticehurst and @jo-oikawa raised briefly?).

I might be missing some security context around this though.

3686625499,Manage Language Models not clearly identifying all information,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Using VSCode Insiders.

Using JAWS for Windows 2026.

1. Open VSCode and open the agent view (ctrl+alt+i).
2. Move to the model picker and press enter ... You are placed on auto. Tab to configure models.
3. You land on a search field.
4. Tab a couple of times and you enter a list. As just an interesting thought, shouldn't this be a treeview with the provider being the parent with sublings underneath?
5. Now, arrow down. You hear each of the models but none of the supplied information that is visually showing on the screen.
6. It is unclear on the user experience here. If I tab after selecting an item I get options to hide from chat and then see buttons that say Tools and Visual. These often repeat when pressing the tab key.

I do have some questions as well:

1. Should their be a checkbox here on an item or is there one and if so the checked state is not showing.
2. How does one download these models specifically if not downloaded from this tool?

Sorry for the lack of knowledge on the intended user experience on this dialog.

3684745757,Fails to navigate to Markdown headers containing extended Unicode characters generated via autocomplete,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

### Description

VS Code cannot reliably navigate to Markdown headers in the Markdown preview when using a link generated by autocomplete for a header that contains extended Unicode characters (e.g., `🔥`, `✔️`).

This happens whether the Unicode character appears at the end of the header or anywhere within it.

It remains unclear whether the problem lies in:

* link generation by autocomplete,
* the Markdown preview’s anchor resolution,
* or a combination of these.

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new text file.
2. Add several lines of filler text.
3. At the bottom, add the header `## 🔥Some header`.
4. At the top of the file, type `[link](#` and select the 'Some header' anchor **from autocomplete**.
5. Open the preview (*Markdown: Open Preview to the Side*).
6. Click the link.  
   → The preview does **not** navigate to the header.

### Actual Behavior

The link does not navigate to the header.

### Expected Behavior

Autocomplete-generated links should correctly navigate to autocomplete-generated headers in the preview.

### Additional hint

If fixed, also test with ✔️. This character behaves differently: when a [Variation Selector-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)) is present, hidden symbols may be added to the generated link text.

3683015393,trying to quickly erase chat panel input will discard all file changes,"Steps to Reproduce:

1. have some pending changes in the chat panel 
2. type out something in the prompt
3. erase the prompt quickly with `ctrl+backspace` and then quickly start typing a new prompt

:bug: if you hit backspace one too many times, followed by a spacebar, all your changes will be discarded.

It took me a while to realize what had happened since I accepted the popup with spacebar before I could read it, but I have now disabled that keybinding because of how disruptive it was.

But if multiple URLs were fetched, _no indication is given in the UI of which URLs were fetched_.

Add a label for each fetched content awaiting approval, indicating from which URL the content was retrieved.

Note that this is particularly needed when the LLM initiates fetch on its own. In those circumstances I will not have indicated any URLs to fetch, so it may not be obvious where the content is from or even about. Furthermore even if the retrieved content appears related to the subject matter, I still need to know specifically which URLs were accessed.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/280346,0

3678318745,TreeDataProvider API: Allow leaf items to align with collapsible siblings (like native Outline view),"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
### Description

Extension authors using `TreeDataProvider` cannot achieve the same visual alignment as VS Code's native **Outline** view. When a tree contains both:
- Items with `TreeItemCollapsibleState.Collapsed` or `TreeItemCollapsibleState.Expanded` (collapsible items with twisties)
- Items with `TreeItemCollapsibleState.None` (leaf items without twisties)

...the leaf items are rendered without reserving space for the twistie, causing visual misalignment with their siblings.

### Current Behavior

In custom tree views built with `TreeDataProvider`, collapsible siblings appear **shifted left** relative to leaf items (`CollapsibleState.None`) at the same level:

```
> CollapsibleParent
     LeafChild             <-- No twistie
  > CollapsibleChild       <-- Has twistie, appears ~20px left of sibling icons
```

### Expected Behavior

Native **Outline** view items at the same tree level are **always vertically aligned**, regardless of collapsibility:

```
> CollapsibleParent
     LeafChild              <-- Reserving twistie space, icon aligned with CollapsibleChild
   > CollapsibleChild       <-- Has twistie
```

### Comparison Screenshots

In the following screenshot, the VSCode native **OUTLINE** treeview has the ""refreshRegions"" branch aligned with its sibling leaves above it.  The [Region Helper](https://github.com/dbookstaber/vscode-region-helper) extension **FULL OUTLINE** treeview has the branch shifted left relative to the sibling leaves above it.

<img width=""384"" height=""471"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b891647-35d3-4b73-9fb9-6072bc4a2c36"" />

### Proposed Solution

One of the following approaches:

1. **TreeItem property**: Add `reserveTwistieSpace?: boolean` to `TreeItem` allowing extensions to opt-in to spacing reservation for leaf items

2. **TreeView option**: Add `alignLeafItems?: boolean` to `TreeViewOptions<T>` in `createTreeView()`

3. **Match Outline behavior**: Update the internal `Aligner` class to check if any siblings have twisties and reserve space accordingly (current behavior checks `CollapsibleState` per-item)

### Technical Context

Looking at VS Code source:
- [`src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/views/treeView.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/views/treeView.ts) - `Aligner` class
- `Aligner.alignIconWithTwisty()` (line ~1639) determines spacing based on individual item's `collapsibleState`
- [`src/vs/base/browser/ui/tree/abstractTree.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/base/browser/ui/tree/abstractTree.ts) (line ~339) has `hideTwistiesOfChildlessElements` option

The native Outline view (via `OutlinePane`) uses different rendering that maintains alignment.

### Affected Extensions

This affects any extension providing a tree view where items at the same level may or may not have children:
- Region/fold markers
- Symbol outlines (custom implementations)  
- Bookmark/todo list extensions
- Any hierarchical data with mixed leaf/branch nodes

### Environment

- VS Code Version: 1.96.x (any recent version)
- OS: Windows / macOS / Linux (all affected)

### Related Issues

- #208180 - Alignment of nested files (closed by user, not fixed)
- #148974 - Better alignment for file nesting (open, Backlog - related but about file explorer specifically)
- #77026 - Custom views left padding (closed 2019)

---

#### Additional Notes

This is a **polish/UX** issue rather than a bug. The current behavior is functional, but makes custom tree views look less polished than native VS Code views like the Outline panel.

The VS Code team member @alexr00 noted in #208180:
> ""I think this is intentional so that it's clearer when an item is a child even where there's a mix of twistie, no-twistie, icon, and no-icon.""

However, the native Outline view demonstrates that consistent alignment IS achievable and looks better. Providing this capability to extension authors would improve the overall VS Code ecosystem quality.

3676944150,VS Code Issue: Git Diff Peek View doesn't support togglePeekWidgetFocus,"## Description
The git diff peek view (triggered by `editor.action.dirtydiff.next`) does not support the `togglePeekWidgetFocus` command, unlike other peek views (Find References, Go to Definition, etc.). This prevents keyboard-only navigation into the diff editor within the peek widget.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open a file with git changes
2. Press `Alt+F3` (or run `editor.action.dirtydiff.next`) to show git diff peek view
3. Try to press any key bound to `togglePeekWidgetFocus` command
4. **Expected**: Focus moves into the diff editor within the peek view
5. **Actual**: Nothing happens; focus remains in the main editor

## Comparison: Working vs Non-Working Peek Views

### ✅ Working: Find References Peek View
```
1. Position cursor on a symbol
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+F12 (Find References)
3. Peek view opens with a list of references
4. Run togglePeekWidgetFocus command
5. ✅ Focus successfully moves into the peek view
```

### ❌ Not Working: Git Diff Peek View
```
1. Position cursor in a file with git changes
2. Press Alt+F3 (Show Next Change)
3. Peek view opens showing git diff
4. Run togglePeekWidgetFocus command
5. ❌ Focus stays in main editor; cannot focus into diff
```

## Source Code Evidence

Looking at the VS Code source code in `src/vs/workbench/contrib/scm/browser/quickDiffWidget.ts`:

### QuickDiffWidget Implementation
```typescript
class QuickDiffWidget extends PeekViewWidget {
    private diffEditor!: EmbeddedDiffEditorWidget;

    override hasFocus(): boolean {
        return this.diffEditor.hasTextFocus();
    }
}
```

### Missing Focus Toggle Action
The `quickDiffWidget.ts` file defines these actions:
- `ShowNextChangeAction` (Alt+F3)
- `ShowPreviousChangeAction` (Shift+Alt+F3)
- Various diff-related actions

**But notably missing**: No action to toggle focus into the peek widget's diff editor.

### Comparison with Standard Peek Views
Standard peek views (references, definitions) work with `togglePeekWidgetFocus` because they properly integrate with the peek view focus system. The git diff peek view appears to have custom focus management that doesn't integrate with this system.

## Impact
Users who prefer keyboard-only workflows cannot:
1. Focus into the git diff peek view to scroll through the diff
2. Select text within the diff editor
3. Interact with the diff using keyboard shortcuts
4. Maintain a fully keyboard-accessible git workflow

Currently, the only workaround is to use the mouse to click inside the peek view.

## Proposed Solution
Add support for `togglePeekWidgetFocus` command in `QuickDiffWidget`, or provide an equivalent command like:
- `editor.action.dirtydiff.togglePeekFocus`
- Or make `QuickDiffWidget` properly integrate with the existing peek widget focus system

## Workarounds (Current)
1. Use `git.openChange` instead of peek view (opens full diff in editor tab)
2. Use mouse to click inside the peek view
3. Close peek view and use alternative diff viewing methods

## Environment
- VS Code Version: All versions (verified against latest source code)
- OS: All platforms
- This is a design/implementation limitation, not OS-specific

## Additional Context
This inconsistency creates confusion for users who expect all peek views to behave similarly. The `togglePeekWidgetFocus` command works for:
- Find References
- Peek Definition
- Peek Type Definition
- Peek Implementation

But NOT for:
- Git diff peek view (dirty diff)

Creating a consistent experience across all peek views would significantly improve keyboard accessibility.

## Related Context Keys
Tested these context keys with no success:
- `peekViewVisible`
- `inDiffEditor`
- `editorHoverFocus`
- `editorHoverVisible`
- `isDirtyDiffVisible`

None of these properly detect when the git diff peek view is active for the purpose of focus toggling.

Ideally if a click results in an element to be focused, we can stay away from applying this style, but this probably needs some kind of new class to account for accordingly, not sure a CSS only solution is possible here.

- OS Version: MacOS Sequoia 15.7.2

## **Type: Bug**

### **Issue Summary:**
MCP Servers are throwing a ""DCR - Dynamic Client Registration not supported"" error when attempting to connect through VS Code's MCP extension.

### **Expected Behavior:**
According to the [ZohoMCP](https://www.zoho.com/mcp/) documentation, Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) is fully supported and functions correctly when MCP servers are connected through intermediary proxies such as [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) or [mcp-connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-connector). The system should automatically handle client registration without requiring manual intervention.

### **Actual Behavior:**
The authorization flow fails with an error indicating that automatic client registration is not supported, forcing users to manually provide a client ID. This breaks the seamless connection experience that was previously available.

### **Version Details:**
- **Working versions (previously used):** VS Code ~1.101.2
- **Broken versions:** VS Code >= 1.106.0
- The issue appeared after updating to the latest version of VS Code, suggesting a regression in the MCP extension or OAuth handling in recent releases.

### **Error Dialog:**
```
The authorization server '{SERVER_URL}' does not support automatic client registration. Do you want to proceed by manually providing a client registration (client ID)?

Note: When registering your OAuth application, make sure to include these redirect URIs:
http://127.0.0.1:33418
https://vscode.dev/redirect
```

### **Queries:**
1. Has this issue been reported by other users?
2. Is this a known regression in version 1.106.0+?
3. Are there any workarounds available to connect My MCP Servers?

### **Additional Context:**
The fact that DCR works with proxy solutions like mcp-remote and mcp-connector confirms that the authorization server does support DCR. This suggests the issue lies within VS Code's implementation rather than the server configuration.

## **Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Log in to the ZohoMCP portal. [Ref](https://mcp.zoho.com)
2. Create a new server and copy the server link from the ""Connect"" tab.
3. Add it to the VS Code mcp config.

The continue.dev extension however works fine and is able to list ollama models with the autodetect defaults. I even tried disabling all extensions except for copilot chat. But I see the same issue.

2. Open VSCode/Insiders -> Go to Chat -> Manage Models
2. Add Models -> Select Ollama. See that no ollama models show up. 


Update: When cloud models like `gemini-3-pro-preview:latest` were removed from ollama, Github Copilot Chat started listing all the models.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/279832,0

Cause:

`createEditor` and `createDiffEditor` both use `StandaloneCodeEditor`, and there is `setHoverDelegateFactory` logic in `constructor`, where `hoverDelegateFactory` is a global singleton, which will be overwritten when the diff editor is created. So when I go back to the first editor and trigger the `cmd + f` shortcut, the `hoverDelegateFactory` on the singleton is from the diff editor, because the diff editor has been destroyed, so the InstantiationService is thrown here

3669238961,"LaTeX mode: RTL/LTR rendering issue with parentheses, brackets, and braces","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

# Description

When mixing Persian (RTL) and English (LTR) text in LaTeX mode in VS Code, delimiters such as parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}` are visually misplaced. Instead of wrapping the intended tokens, they appear flipped or shifted due to bidirectional text rendering.

This issue only occurs in **LaTeX mode**. In Plaintext or other language modes (e.g., R), delimiters render correctly. It seems related to the LaTeX grammar tokenization, which splits text into multiple spans. Chromium’s bidi algorithm then misplaces delimiters across RTL/LTR tokens.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open VS Code with LaTeX Workshop enabled.
2. Create a `.tex` file and insert mixed RTL/LTR text with delimiters, for example:

3667359321,Claude Opus 4.5 summarizes history at every step,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I've consistently reproduced this issue every time I start a chat with Claude Opus 4.5. After a while, the agent will begin summarizing conversation history after every step, considerably slowing down responses. 
The only fix is creating a fresh chat.

**Title:** WSL: `code-insiders` fails with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `resources/app/out/cli.js` in 1.107.0-insider

**VS Code Version:** 1.107.0-insider
**Commit:** 2d69e225bfc64f111fdb9b9294a76bfbff1e99c0
**OS Version:** Windows 11 Enterprise 24H2 (Build 26100.7171) + WSL Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (jammy)
**Node.js (from error):** v22.21.1
**Edition:** VS Code Insiders for Windows, launched from WSL (`code-insiders`)

---

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install VS Code Insiders 1.107.0-insider on Windows.

2. Open a WSL Ubuntu terminal.

3. Run:

   ```sh
   code-insiders .
   ```

4. Observe the error.

---

### Actual Behavior

`code-insiders` fails to start and prints:

```text
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1393
  throw err;
  ^

Error: Cannot find module 'C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\resources\\app\\out\\cli.js'
    at Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1390:15)
    at defaultResolveImpl (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1032:19)
    at resolveForCJSWithHooks (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1037:22)
    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1199:37)
    at c._load (node:electron/js2c/node_init:2:17993)
    at TracingChannel.traceSync (node:diagnostics_channel:328:14)
    at wrapModuleLoad (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:244:24)
    at Module.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:186:5)
    at node:internal/main/run_main_module:36:49 {
  code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
  requireStack: []
}

Node.js v22.21.1
```

---

### Expected Behavior

`code-insiders .` from WSL should launch VS Code Insiders on Windows and open the current folder.

---

### Additional Info

* In WSL, `which code-insiders` returns:

  ```text
  /mnt/c/Users/<user>/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code Insiders/bin/code-insiders
  ```

* The Windows install directory looks like this:

  ```text
  Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\
    Code - Insiders.exe
    bin\\
    2d69e225bf\\
      resources\\app\\out\\cli.js
    (no resources\\ directory at the install root)
  ```

* So the WSL launcher appears to look for:

  ```text
  <install-root>\\resources\\app\\out\\cli.js
  ```

  but in this Insiders build the `resources` directory is under a versioned subfolder (`2d69e225bf\\resources\\app\\out\\cli.js`, where `2d69e225bf` matches the first 10 chars of the commit hash).

* This reproduces for me on two different machines and two different Windows versions and Ubuntu WSL distros.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

prompt asked 'there are only four I want to pull out. what is the best thing to filter on? vpc id or vpc name or something else?' 
Correct response was recieved initially but then it just started endlessly looking at other tf files.

eg.

I will update the code to use vpc-id.

I'll also check if I can find the VPC ID in the prd folder, maybe in vars.tf or main.tf.

I'll read vars.tf and main.tf just in case the VPC ID is defined there.

I'll read vars.tf.

I'll read main.tf.

3663858061,Claude models (4.5 series) never use codebase search but only fileSearch or textSearch,"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates -->
<!-- Please attach logs to help us diagnose your issue -->

- Copilot Chat Extension Version: 0.33.2
- VS Code Version: 1.106.2
- OS Version: Windows 11/WSL2
- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): Agent mode
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): Claude Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5

I have tested these models since their releases in GitHub Copilot and noticed this behavior. The semantic search tool (codebase) never get invoked even after a 2 hours session of code migration task.

I haven't had enough time with GPT 5/5.1 family but I could tell the new Gemini 3 Pro has the same behavior. 

They especially use so much regex search. This means massive token waste when big model like Opus run for 5 mins just to collect the context. 

This may come from the tool description that is too general and the models are trained to use the grep-like tools instead. I think we should give more priority to the semantic search tool.

The only fix I could think of right now is specifically mentioning the codebase tool which is not ideal.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/279401,0

Not sure: Link as https://vscode.download.prss.microsoft.com/dbazure/download/insider/51e7119ccb43f1e1dbb3d059bfc9bac09eebb8cb/VSCode-win32-x64-1.107.0-insider.zip

- OS Version: Windows 11 Professional

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Check for newer version of VSCode insider.
2. Download newer version
3. Extract contents to overwrite old files - Found new folder structure in zip file
4. Detect new folder structure. Run the VSCode-insider.exe but the old settings was reset.

I found the folder was instead like this:

<img width=""756"" height=""262"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e9a695-a089-4034-98f7-2ffa710605d4"" />

But the older folder was like this:

<img width=""875"" height=""755"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31768477-3155-464a-a008-30bde1b23609"" />

Was there a change in the code base? I'm not sure about this but all of plugins recently update were seems not recognised.

Hope to hear you opinion

Thanks

Crucially: When the user attempts to scroll manually using the mouse wheel while dragging, the selection extension stops. The bug occurs when the mouse is dragged past the boundary, forcing the high-speed auto-scroll, indicating a failure in the event handler for this specific auto-scroll action. After this forced auto-scrolling selection is complete, the selection state is corrupted, causing subsequent single clicks to initiate an extended selection.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an .ipynb file with a code cell that contains enough text to exceed the editor's visible height (requires scrolling).
2. Attempt to select the entire cell content by starting a drag selection inside the cell.
3. Attempt to manually scroll down while dragging to extend the selection to the bottom of the cell.
4. Observe: Manual scrolling is blocked. The editor forces an automatic, high-speed drag-scrolling motion to extend the selection.
5. Release the mouse button (selection is complete).
6. Single-click anywhere inside the cell (triggers ghost selection).

Actual Behavior
The single click registers as a selection extension (Shift + Click), with the selection automatically extending from the previous selection's end point to the new single-click location.
This ""ghost selection"" state persists even after attempting to clear it with the Esc key, and is not reliably cleared by navigating to other cells.
The issue only clears temporarily upon physical mouse disconnection/reconnection or a full tab switch (switching to another file tab and returning).
This behavior persists even after trying to clear the state with the Esc key.

Expected Behavior
The editor should allow for manual drag-scrolling (scrolling the viewport while holding the mouse button down).
A single click after any selection should clear the previous selection and place the text cursor at the new location.

The initial troubleshooting process focused on isolating the bug's origin, ruling out common causes like extension conflicts, environment issues, and hardware faults. This included testing the bug in the latest stable version of VS Code as well as the Insiders version, with all user-installed extensions disabled using the safe mode (code --disable-extensions). The issue persisted across all these configurations. Furthermore, physical device troubleshooting was performed: the user replaced the mouse hardware, but the bug continued to reproduce. Attempts to reset the selection state using keyboard commands, specifically pressing the Esc key repeatedly, also failed to clear the residual ""ghost selection."" The only temporary relief was observed when the mouse was physically disconnected and reconnected.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/279287,0
3661449456,Double clicking the bash terminal shortcut opens a new terminal,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I like to have 2 or more bash terminals open at once in Vscode.

Up until a week or so ago, I used to swap between them by double clicking.

A single click would swap from one terminal to another - and still does.
A double click would swap, and instantly place the cursor in the window, so that I could begin typing immediately (e.g: `git status`).

But now - a double click does not swap - it instead duplicates the bash window, resulting in me now having an extra new one.

Version: 1.107.0-insider (system setup)
Commit: 29ea21caf8e29d76a96bcb651a05feb07891cfa7

The integrated terminal suggest stopped working for me about 2-3 weeks ago, and found the issue as to why I think.

I profiled the process when the warning popped up, and 95% of the time is being spent in isExecutable inside terminalSuggestMain.js.

Looking at the source for `isExecutable` in the extension, it looks like there's a performance issue in the Windows path. It seems to be recalculating the list of allowed extensions (creating a new Set, new Array, and filtering) for every single file it checks.

<img width=""1051"" height=""108"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94106e5b-0dd0-4f21-89e0-6903ccd15933"" />

```
// It looks like this inner function runs for every file check?
const i = function(e) {
    const n = t.windowsDefaultExecutableExtensions,
          i = new Set;
    if (e)
        for (const [t, a] of Object.entries(e)) !0 === a ? n.push(t) : i.add(t);
    return Array.from(new Set(n)).filter(e => !i.has(e))
}(n);
```

Steps to Reproduce:

1. On Windows, open a workspace with a decent amount of files.
2. Trigger terminal suggestions (or just wait for the background scan).
3. Extension host becomes unresponsive.

Environment:
Windows 11
VS Code Insiders
terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled: true

I thought this might be been due to oh-my-posh, psreadline, malformed paths in path env var, but changing all of those don't seem to make a difference.

The weird thing is, if I run git-bash from the integrated terminal, it works fine:

<img width=""781"" height=""329"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/380d0955-31d6-45ae-b4fd-933261d0cf62"" />

But any other profile (pwsh 7.5 / pwsh 5 / cmd prompt) dont work at all and just get stuck at ""Loading...""

<img width=""509"" height=""64"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f15465d3-d93b-4e97-8201-e793dd275b13"" />

my guess is that for some reason the path-var on my windows system causes it to scan everything, but that same var isnt preset in git-bash for whatever reason?

3660373259,javascript private member shown as color,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Hello,
I am Thierry Dellac from France.

The problem happens when i create a private member in a javascript class (js file).
If the name of the member looks like a css color (ex: '#add' or '#ADD') the editor marks it as a color with a little colored square on the left of then name like in a css file.
Below a sample.

```js
class Calc {
   #add(a, b) { return a + b; }
   #sub(a, b) { return a - b; }
}
```

1. ask copilot to complete a complex task
2. Copilot reads files and create plans
3. then it did nothing


Most of the time, it abruptly ends the conversation without any error, as if it has completed its task.

When I try to use the `filter` ThemeIcon - either in a `QuickInputButton` (see code below) or in a TreeView `view/Title` command button as ` ""icon"": ""$(filter)""` they both show the `list-filter` icon (note the top right icon):

```ts
  const filterButton: QuickInputButton = {
    iconPath: new ThemeIcon('filter'),
    tooltip: 'Toggle Filter'
  } as const;

  qp.ignoreFocusOut = true;
 
  qp.buttons = [filterButton];
```
or for a TreeView `view/title`:

```ts
    ""menus"": {
      ""view/title"": [ 
        {
          ""command"": ""symbolsTree.getFilter"",

3654954617,Copilot always gets stuck when performing second terminal command,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

It seems like there's a race condition or failure of communication between the Copilot agent chat and the terminal.

Copilot will run a terminal command. The command runs successfully. But Copilot seems to get stuck waiting for a response (there is a spinning circle but nothing more happens).

I then have to hit the stop button and enter an instruction like ""continue"" and then it will retry the command and proceed successfully for a while, until it gets stuck again.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

I have some Hebrew text in my Obsidian vault, which I typically edit with VSCode. Screenshots below are VSCode 1.106.2 on the left, Notepad on the right. VSCode versions 1.106.0 & earlier rendered like Notepad does, when I updated to 1.106.2 it went nuts. It also renders correctly in VSCode MD Preview. The only issue is the text in the editor being scrambled in a weird way.

Ref https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-internalbacklog/issues/6311

I can still click on the `Continue Chat in...` arrow button and the options within it, even if I don't have any content in my chat panel input box. Nothing happens if I click on the background or cloud option, when there's no prompt to submit:

Should these options either be grayed out, or provide some sort of notice to users that they need to include a prompt?

I think this implies that there is something stateful in the renderer which shouldn't be, maybe I could get the same thing by scrolling around

- VS Code Version: 1.107 and later
- OS Version: 

It appears that the Code-Insiders packages uploaded on Nov 18–19 to the Microsoft [YUM repository](https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode/Packages/c/) contain malformed version strings that prevent Code-Insiders from updating correctly.

The published RPMs are:
- `code-insiders-1.107.20251118007-1763443123.el8.x86_64.rpm`
- `code-insiders-1.107.20251119008-1763529670.el8.x86_64.rpm`

However, the version component should follow the standard format:
- `code-insiders-1.107.0-1763443123.el8.x86_64.rpm`
- `code-insiders-1.107.0-1763529670.el8.x86_64.rpm`

Because the version numbers include an unintended build timestamp segment, package managers treat them as invalid and ignore these releases, blocking updates for Code-Insiders.

Please correct the package versions in the repository so that YUM/DNF can recognize and install the latest builds.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Check the [YUM](https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode/Packages/c/) repository at the URL above.
2. Observe that recent release versions are incorrect.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278698,0

3650043577,Custom mode is not retained during reload,"1. Select ""plan"" mode in chat

3. 🐛  you're back to agent mode

The first invocation of this promise is an empty array `[]`

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4c9690360822f00568772dba45b86554c0e86de5/src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/common/promptSyntax/service/promptsServiceImpl.ts#L104

Therefore, although we cache custom modes, we remove the plan mode here

Which causes us to fall back here

VS Code

- Version: 1.106.2

Extensions

- github.copilot — Version: 1.388.0
- github.copilot-chat — Version: 0.33.2


What I've tried:

- Logged out and logged back in → error persists
- 
- Uninstalled and reinstalled both extensions → still broken
- 
- Restarted VS Code and my system

Problem:
Copilot shows %github.copilot.viewsWelcome.signIn% instead of the sign-in interface.

Question:
How do I fix this? Has anyone else run into this localization/UI string issue?

Type: <b>Bug</b>

The agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5) got stuck (commit editor opened in a VSCode terminal, but no further actions were taken) on the following command. If the agent waits for the user to take action in the terminal it should indicate so in the chat (no indication was given):

```
git add -A && git cherry-pick --continue
```

- Create a new CCA chat editor
- Delegate a task to CCA via that new chat editor
- While that task is still in the state `Creating pull request`, I use the chat panel to type out another prompt and delegate that new prompt to CCA as well

     - I open the Agent Sessions view to investigate, but the list is long, and I can't tell if I have any tasks in progress (it doesn't appear so)
     - I need to manually refresh the Agent Sessions view to actually see both sessions I just delegated - and I see they're actually both successfully in-progress (despite the chat panel error)

     - I can't easily find and reopen my previous CLI editor from the chat panel
          - See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278481
     - It's difficult to discern which sessions were in-progress, which I can reopen, if/why they stopped from the long list in the Agent Sessions view
          - <img width=""544"" height=""256"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6356d3ad-8bb1-4943-b2eb-58c1d08a6ec6"" />
     - Even if I split the editor myself and open both CLI instances, I can't actually work with both background tasks at once 
          - It's also unclear that they were stopped prematurely earlier - neither of their log output indicates this
          - <img width=""1959"" height=""1125"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a4e3a7d-7e0c-4fb4-9f83-ce8a327c0b07"" />

I think these will largely be mitigated by auto-creating and using a git worktree with the CLI. But in the meantime, should we do anything else here? Such as:
- Splitting the editor (so adding a new CLI editor, rather than stopping + replacing the first in-progress one)
- Blocking or warning users when trying to delegate another session to the CLI from the chat panel",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278642,0

When attempting to connect to VSCode to setup the MCP Registry integration, it is expecting the schema for the json to be ""2025-9-29"".
When attempting to setup the integration with the open source MCP registry from the mcp group, which uses schema ""2025-10-17"", we are seeing serialization errors in VSCode.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup MCP Registry that uses ""2025-10-17"" Schema.
2. In the GitHub Copilot admin console for my enterprise, add the url to the MCP Registy.
3. Open VSCode and sign into my GitHub account.
4. Search for MCP servers in the extension view.
5. See serialization error in the Output view -> Window, MCPs do not populate in extensions view.

- Copilot Chat Extension Version: 0.33.2
- VS Code Version: 1.106.1
- OS Version: MacOS - Tahoe 26.1
- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): Agent (Custom Agents)
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): Model Independent, but definitely Claude 4.5
- Logs: Not included, fully reproducible.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Activate the GitHub MCP
```json
                ""github"": {
			""url"": ""https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"",
			""type"": ""http""
		},
```
3. Add an Agent file
4. Add a Github tool such as `issue_read`.  Note the blue underline, and tooltip recommending using the form `github/issue_read`
5. Switch to that agent mode in the chat pane.
6. Ask the agent which tools it has access to, note the github tools are available.
7. Change the tool to have the `github` prefix like `github/issue_read`.  Note the yello underline and warning message.
8. Ask the agent what tools are available.  Note the github tools are not available.

Updated: Now we have a temporary solution from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons/issues/378 that provides a https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adam-bender.vscode-oldicons.

As described in the update report [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_106#_refreshed-iconography), we notice ""refreshed iconography"" of _debug toolbar icons_ appear to be really worse on 1440p screen, it's too thin and too small that **BLUR** compared to previous version.

The new icons introduced in VS Code 1.106.1 lack sufficient contrast. Both the ""New File"" and ""New Folder"" icons are rounded and smaller, and they share the same large ""+"" symbol.
As a result, I see two round icons displaying the same ""+"".
My brain freezes and starts wondering: Where are the icons?! I can’t recognize them immediately and end up searching for them.
Please revert to the old icons, which worked perfectly fine.

> such as authentication

I'm starting to think that this isn't a good recommendation.

> _Let's set aside the `authentication` section I added in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/277962_

I have been trying to use existing API to get GH MCP working in-box but authentication lifecycle is complicated and I don't think the API as it is today, has the events in place.

Here's what I was doing (pseudo code):
```ts
	contructor() {
		this.onDidChangeMcpServerDefinitions = this.authenticationService.onDidAuthenticationChange;
	}

	provideMcpServerDefinitions(): McpHttpServerDefinition[] {
		const toolsets = this.toolsets.sort().join(',');
		return [
			{
				label: 'GitHub',
				uri: URI.parse('https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/'),
				headers: {
					'X-MCP-Toolsets': toolsets
				},
				version: this.signedIn ? toolsets : 'signed-out'
			}
		];
	}

	async resolveMcpServerDefinition(server: McpHttpServerDefinition, token: CancellationToken): Promise<McpHttpServerDefinition> {
		const session = await this.authenticationService.getPermissiveGitHubSession({
			createIfNone: {
				detail: l10n.t('Additional permissions are required to use GitHub MCP Server'),
			},
		});
		server.headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${session!.accessToken}`;
		return server;
	}
```


So, the good news is that `this.authenticationService.onDidAuthenticationChange` triggers `provideMcpServerDefinitions`... and I tried changing the version when signed out to signal this... but I noticed:
1. The server is still running after a version bump 
    <img width=""652"" height=""205"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98fc1189-b1cd-44fb-ba4e-9420e5f45e3d"" />
2. Update Tools spins forever? No additional logs come in to the opened Output channel
    <img width=""1091"" height=""1094"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9d61614-af42-4632-96e0-cde4773193e2"" />
    Could it be trying to send a refresh tool message to the old server connection?

When I sign out, I want to be able to signal to core that the currently ""running"" server is no longer valid and a new connection should be refreshed.

Maybe this issue is just a bug in the MCP Server lifecycle... or maybe something like fixing https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278407 would fix this.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278420,0

```

This started happening right after I cleared the existing Gemini API key (left it blank). Since then, I’m unable to add any Gemini API key again.

What I tried

- Removing the Copilot Chat extension
- Reinstalling VS Code Insiders
- Clearing temp/cache files
- Removing Insiders sync settings
- Full reinstall of everything

No luck so far — the extension still refuses to accept any Gemini API key.

Expected behavior

- Selecting “gemini” in Manage Models should allow me to enter a new API key and save it successfully.
- Actual behavior
- Selecting “gemini” does nothing, and the extension logs an API_KEY_INVALID error even before I can input anything.

- OS Version: Darwin arm64 25.1.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. open a lot of things 
2. open a clone of https://github.com/check-spelling-sandbox/MAPIE.git
3. open the sarif report
4. open notebooks/classification/Cifar10.ipynb
5. change `Tensorflow` and `tensorflow` to `TensorFlow` (some instances can be edited by just clicking and changing, some require clicking a pencil and then a check mark)
6. Try to close the pane
7. It eventually provides a prompt asking if you want to save--choose save -- this doesn't work
8. Manually edit the file to the same effect using TERMINAL pane
9. Try to close the pane again (many times)

#### Steps Tried
- Full uninstall and deletion of user/data folders
- Reboot and clean install of latest Insiders
- Stable build works (`v1.100.2`), only Insiders crashes
- Tried launching with `--log trace --disable-extensions`, no logs produced

#### Impact
- **No logs generated**
- **Crash is immediate, before application or extension loading**
- **Cannot use VSCode Insiders at all on Windows**

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Update to the latest VSCode Insiders v1.107.36256.0 for Windows.
2. Launch `code-insiders`.

#### Notes
- The previous Insiders build (1.106.0) worked fine.
- The issue appears specific to the latest build.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278339,0
3641752896,Terminal file suggestion has bad sorting,"Setup: be in a directory which has a `.build` and `build folder.

1. Type `cd .bu`

🐛 `./build/` will be selected first... instead of `./.build` which is a better match (because the characters are contiguous, vs. the apparent current heuristic of first character appearing earlier in the match).

OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.26200

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a `.github/agents/my-agent.md` file 
2. Add the following text to the file:
    ```markdown
    ---
    name: File with a space in the display name
    description: An agent configuration file that has a space in its name.
    ---
    Do nothing
    ```

**Expected:** Dropdown for selecting an agent includes ""File with a space in the display name"", no editor squiggles

**Actual:** Name property shows an error, agent is called my-agent:

Copilot coding agent and the Copilot CLI also do not allow filenames with spaces, but VS Code seems to allow this - which would make sense to have Copilot line up with if VS Code does allow spaces in filenames.

- install extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-mcp-server
- this extension contributes an MCP server
- open a prompt file e.g. `.github\\prompts\\build-champ.prompt.md`
- in the prompt file use the code lens 'Configure Tools'
- In the tool picker select the `Azure MCP` entry. It is MCP server contributed by the extension

- in the prompt file you end up with
```
---
agent: agent
tools: ['Azure MCP/*', 'todos']
---
```

The server toolset should return an id that matches other ids of mcp servers
- has no spaces
- for contributed mcp servers, at least 3 segments
- allows us to locate the extension that contributes the mcp server so we can offer to install it when missing
something like `ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-mcp-server/azure-mcp/`

I see in [vscode.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/236be7c1cb61075e94e7d568793e0ff09cd92678/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L20327) that we don't have an id, only a label. Maybe lowercase the label and convert spaces to dashes to create an id?

When we see a tool set that has a name with 2 segments, then we
- if the first segment is in the form `name.name`, assume it's from an extension
- if not, assume it can be found in the MCP registry",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278152,0

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18ae9bf8-0c56-4d0c-a8ad-902300498287

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a new chat session and prompt the agent with:
   ```
   #runInTerminal run `echo ""(hi!)""`
   ```
2. Click *Allow*.
3. Observe the terminal running command hangs indefinitely.


When you pop open the hidden chat it shows it's complete, but the Chat Window still thinks the command is running.

NB: The example I've given is a minimal repro, but this organically happened in a more complex session where the agent was running some python and bash.

3633590479,Auto should pick fast model for inline chat,"Related to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/275772

Inline chat is very perf sensitive (more than sidebar chat). Also inline chat is only making changes in one file (thus we can assume the complexity is lower than agent mode).

Due to that when Inline chat uses Auto, Auto should ideally resolve a Fast model for inline chat - even though it might not be the most capable one. Maybe it is related to task-based intent, but maybe this is step 1 in achieving general task-based classification.

There could be a future where the model dropdown is less prominent in inline chat.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open Copilot CLI session from ""Agent Session"" side bar
2. Ask it to use a tool to search your repo for a simple phrase
3. Don't accept or reject tool permission, just write a new message
4. New chat window opens, but go back to first window
5. Type a new message, observe tool call failures (it will happen 5 times with retries)
6. If you type additional messages it will keep failure (until you clear the context with a new session)

This seems like it might be a problem unique to Sonnet, I didn't observe the same thing with GPT-5. From my pov it shouldn't spawn a new window and succeed in the original window. The same sequence with the chat session does not produce this behavior.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open repository with not synced changes
2. Click on the node which is displayed above ""Incoming changes""
3. It should expands and shows file which was modified, but it's not visible

It looks like that it happens only for the first node above ""Incoming changes"".

For what it's worth, I suppose that it's related to - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/a6116095cb9b0e5938155d2d2f55dc86ec274e03, and probably the problem is here:
```js

```
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/a6116095cb9b0e5938155d2d2f55dc86ec274e03#diff-0f1f3f0afd033aecdb70d684a1465f4398916a508965902b840c6c576c1e6181R475

So later in:
```js
const historyItemChanges = await historyProvider?.provideHistoryItemChanges(historyItemId, historyItemParentId) ?? [];
```

a value of `historyItemParentId` is `scm-graph-incoming-changes`, so it does not find changes.

3630246537,"Misrendering of bidirectional punctuation ((), [], {}) in Persian-English mixed text in VSCode","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open a new file in VSCode (e.g., Markdown or plain text).
2. Type a sentence in Persian that includes English words inside punctuation marks, such as:
   (data frame), [ggplot], or {tidyverse}
3. Observe how the punctuation marks are rendered around the English words when mixed with Persian (RTL) text.

**Expected behavior:**  
Punctuation marks like (), [], and {} should remain visually correct and aligned, even when mixed with Persian and English text.

**Actual behavior:**  
Parentheses, brackets, and braces appear flipped, broken, or misaligned when used around English words in Persian text. This issue affects readability and was not present in previous versions.

The LLM (GPT Codex 5.1 Mini) stop in the middle of the task too frequently. It needs a supervision of the programmer, commanding ""Continue"" every time it break the task in the middle. It will then continue the task for a small while, and stop again waiting for another ""continue"". It would never finish the task in once. 
GPT-5 Code Mini总是在未完成任务的时候停止任务, 需要发送 ""继续"" 才能再工作一小会, 直到它又停下来.

3627977043,Mixed arabic and franch writing not at the right place,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

Since your last update of VS Code, I experience a very unpleasant behaviour from VS Code.
I use txt documents that are written with both arabic and french.
Before the update, the arabic words used to appear in VS Code editor just like they appear in any word processor.
Since the update, in the same documents, we now have the first arabic word of the line that appears at the right end of the line. This has no impact on the text processing and the code understands the structure of the text just like before. The problem is that it is extremely annoying not to know where exactly the cursor is. As for text selection with the mouse it is almost impossible to make it...
Can you please show me the way to solve this issue?

OS (local): Windows 11

Remote Host: Linux (connected via Remote-SSH)

Remote workspace path (expected): 

/abc/def

Copilot: enabled with custom agent stored in workspace under:

/abc/def/.github/testws.json

Problem Description

When using GitHub Copilot Agents (or the built-in Copilot tool calls) inside a Remote-SSH workspace, all “file creation” or “open file” actions incorrectly use Windows UNC paths such as:

\\abc\\def

Instead of correct Linux paths like

/abc/def

Because of this:

VS Code creates the file on the Windows UNC share, not on the SSH remote.

The file appears in VS Code Explorer but is not present on the Linux filesystem.

The integrated terminal on the SSH host cannot see the file (ls shows nothing).

File tabs in VS Code display Windows-style paths even though the workspace is supposed to be remote.

This makes Copilot tools unusable in Remote-SSH scenarios.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277493,0

# Bug Report: MCP Array Parameters Failing in VS Code 1.106.0

## Environment
- **VS Code Version**: 1.106.0 (commit: ac4cbdf48759c7d8c3eb91ffe6bb04316e263c57)
- **OS**: Windows 11 Enterprise
- **GitHub Copilot Extension**: 1.388.0
- **GitHub Copilot Chat Extension**: 0.33.1
- **MCP Protocol**: Model Context Protocol servers

## Description
MCP tools with array parameters are failing with validation error ""must be array"" when called from GitHub Copilot, even when valid JSON arrays are provided. This is a regression - the same tools worked correctly in previous VS Code versions.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Configure an MCP server with a tool that accepts array parameters:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""addNotesToAlertsAndThreats"",
  ""inputSchema"": {
    ""type"": ""object"",
    ""properties"": {
      ""alertIds"": {
        ""type"": ""array"",
        ""items"": {""type"": ""string""},
        ""description"": ""List of alert IDs""
      },
      ""noteText"": {
        ""type"": ""string"",
        ""description"": ""The note text to add""
      }
    },
    ""required"": [""noteText""]
  }
}
```

2. Call the tool from GitHub Copilot with valid array syntax:
```json
{
  ""alertIds"": [""2347372677834199395""],
  ""noteText"": ""Test note""
}
```

3. **Expected Result**: Tool executes successfully with the array parameter
4. **Actual Result**: Error message: ""Your input to the tool was invalid (must be array)""

## Additional Details

- The error occurs **before** the request reaches the MCP server (validated via server logs)
- This appears to be a client-side parameter validation bug in GitHub Copilot's MCP implementation
- The same tool definition works correctly when:
  - Called directly via the MCP server's Python code
  - Used in VS Code versions prior to 1.106.0
- Multiple array formats attempted, all fail:
  - `[""value""]` (single element)
  - `[""value1"", ""value2""]` (multiple elements)
  - With/without escaping

## Impact
- **Severity**: High - Breaks existing MCP tools that use array parameters
- **Workaround**: Modify tools to accept comma-separated strings instead of arrays (requires server code changes)
- **Affected Tools**: Any MCP tool with array-type parameters

## MCP Server Configuration
```json
{
  ""servers"": {
    ""sentinel_one"": {
      ""command"": ""python"",
      ""args"": [""src/mcp/sentinel_one/sentinel_one_server.py""]
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Context
The error message suggests the parameter validation is happening in the GitHub Copilot MCP client layer, before the JSON-RPC request is sent to the MCP server. This indicates a regression in how the Copilot extension validates MCP tool schemas against provided arguments.

## Logs Available
- VS Code terminal logs showing the error
- MCP server logs (no requests received, confirming client-side failure)
- Tool schema definitions from working MCP server

## Request
Please investigate the MCP parameter validation logic in VS Code 1.106.0 / GitHub Copilot extension to identify why valid JSON arrays are being rejected for array-type parameters in MCP tool schemas.

3625614003,Problem matcher stopped working,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

The problem matcher stopped working when updating to the October 2025 update (v1.106).

I use a background task with ""tsc --watch"" and the built-in ""$tsc-watch""-problem matcher. I can still see that the task is running correctly and is outputting problems in its terminal window, but the problems are no longer showing up in the editor's ""Problems""-tab.

My task config:

```json
{
  ""version"": ""2.0.0"",
  ""tasks"": [{
    ""label"": ""tsc-watch"",
    ""type"": ""shell"",
    ""isBackground"": true,
    ""command"": ""tsc --watch --noEmit --skipLibCheck"",
    ""problemMatcher"": ""$tsc-watch"",
    ""presentation"": {
      ""reveal"": ""never"",
      ""clear"": true
    },
    ""runOptions"": { ""runOn"": ""folderOpen"" }
  }]
}
```

3624635384,Text Selection Becomes Discontinuous When Scrolling with Mouse Wheel After 2025 October Update,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

After updating VS Code to the 2025 October release, an issue occurs when selecting text with the mouse. When holding down the left mouse button to select code or text, scrolling the document with the mouse wheel no longer extends the selection continuously. Instead, the selection highlight (blue background) only updates after the scroll movement is completed, resulting in a delayed and visually discontinuous selection effect.

This behavior severely affects workflows in Jupyter Notebook within VS Code: while holding the left mouse button and scrolling with the wheel, the text selection does not expand as expected. The selection remains fixed until scrolling stops, making it impossible to select larger code blocks smoothly.

After downgrading back to the 2025 September release, the problem disappears, and text selection while scrolling works normally again.

Title
System file dialog shows English despite VS Code and OS set to zh-CN

Body
Steps to reproduce
1. Install Chinese language pack (`ms-ceintl.vscode-language-pack-zh-hans`).
2. Set VS Code display language to Chinese (e.g. write `{""locale"":""zh-CN""}` to `%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\locale.json`) and restart VS Code.
3. Trigger a native file dialog (e.g. File  Open Folder).

Expected
- Native file dialog (open/save/select folder) shows Chinese.

Actual
- Native file dialog shows English (e.g. button labeled Select folder), while VS Code is set to `zh-CN`.

Key diagnostics
- `Get-Culture` => `zh-CN`
- `CurrentUICulture` => `en-US`
- `Get-WinSystemLocale` / registry `HKCU\\Control Panel\\International\\LocaleName` => `zh-CN`

Notes
- Chinese language pack is installed and `locale.json` is set to `zh-CN`, but the current user UI culture remains `en-US`, which likely causes native dialogs to stay English. Screenshot and PowerShell outputs attached.

Suggested labels
- `area: localization`, `platform: windows`, `type: bug`

Optional dev checks (for maintainers)
- In VS Code DevTools Console: `navigator.language`
- In PowerShell: `Get-Culture; [System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::CurrentUICulture; Get-WinUserLanguageList`",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277334,0
3623644249,Edit information not restored when re-opening a copilot chat session,"This applies to existing sessions as well as when a new session is created.
I.e. scenario mentioned here is pretty much the same https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274198#issuecomment-3482005925

In both cases we're trying to restore/swap some edit session.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277322,0
3623410244,Closing and reopening chat agent window hides chat history.,"In the October 2025 release, sometimes if I'm in the middle of making edits in Agent mode and I close the side chat panel using `Ctrl+Alt+b`, when I reopen it there is no chat history shown.

If I attempt to bring it back by clicking on the chat history button, it says:

> Switching chats will end your current edit session. Do you want to keep pending edits to 1 files?

Restarting VS Code will bring back the history.

This is similar to #274767, but arguably worse because it will happen during an existing VS Code instance, not just when starting a new VS Code instance.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Try to start MCP server.
2. Observe error 
""Error sending message to https://xxxxxx/: Error: X509 to PEM conversion""

Notes:
- The issue doesn't reproduce on every machine but on this one does
- Rolling back to 1.105 mitigates the issue
- Maybe a coincidence but with 1.106 you are bumping node.js to 22.20 for which major change is OpenSSL library version

```",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277260,0
3622701580,Shockingly Slow when working on a reply,"
Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

I asked a simple question, and I'm seeing:
- ""Used 2 references
- ""Checking CI changes""
- ""Read ci.yml""
- ""Read Dockerfile.runtime""
- ""Proposing Dockerfile changes...""

It's been stuck on that last item for several minutes. As of writing - 21:23 hrs on 13 Nov 2025 German Time - Github Copilot is atrociously slow and essentially unusable despite plenty of network bandwidth.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

1) from chat delegate to a task to the cloud agent
2) let the cloud agent finish
3) in chat open the PR and then the session
-> you get an editor with the chat icon
4) ensure editor is not in preview mode
5) in the agent sessions view, open the same session
-> you get a second editor with a cloud agent icon and a different title

3621967716,Using QuickInputButton with a 'toggle' method throws an error about disallowed API proposal,"See 
https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/4007#issuecomment-3524609700
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/221397#issuecomment-2225357158

The new `toggle` member was added and is checked for this API proposal:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144956

The customer had a `toggle` method on a class that derives from QuickInputButton and is now getting an error while they are actually not using the API proposal, but we find the `toggle` and throw.

The solution is to check the `toggle` member shape, not just existence, before throwing.

3621337713,WebviewView panels become blank whenever Terminal panel is opened (Only WebviewPanel survives),"
Type: <b>Bug</b>


**Environment**

* **VS Code Insiders** (latest, macOS ARM)
* macOS (Apple Silicon)
* Multiple extensions providing **WebviewView**-based views (AMP, Codex, Hugo, Mermaid, etc.)
* Copilot Chat installed (uses **WebviewPanel**, not WebviewView)

---

## **Problem Summary**

Opening the **Terminal** panel immediately causes all **WebviewView**-based side panels to become blank.
Only **WebviewPanel**-based views (e.g., Copilot Chat) continue to render normally.

Dragging the panels to other locations, splitting them, resizing, switching themes, or reloading the window does not restore them.
Closing the Terminal panel instantly restores all WebviewView views.

This is **100% reproducible**.

---

## **Expected Behavior**

WebviewView-based panels should render regardless of whether the Terminal panel is open.

---

## **Actual Behavior**

1. Open VS Code Insiders
2. Open several WebviewView-based views (AMP, Hugo, Mermaid, etc.)
3. Open the bottom **Terminal** panel
4. All WebviewView panels become **empty/blank**
5. Only “Copilot Chat” (which uses WebviewPanel API) continues to work
6. Closing Terminal restores all WebviewView views

Errors in the output panel:

## **Confirmed Non-Causes**

* Not caused by GPU acceleration
* Not caused by terminal renderer (`terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration`)
* Not caused by webview iframe mode (`window.experimental.useIFrameWebview`)
* Not caused by experimental layout settings:

  * `workbench.experimental.useViewContainerLayout`
  * `workbench.editor.experimental.useNewEditorLayout`
  * `workbench.experimental.layoutControl.enabled`
* Not caused by extensions (reproduced with multiple independent WebviewView extensions)
* Not a theme or layout issue

This bug affects **only WebviewView-based view containers**.

---

## **Diagnosis**

This appears to be a regression in the **ViewContainer + WebviewView rendering pipeline** in VS Code Insiders.
Opening the Terminal panel seems to invalidate or detach the rendering context for all WebviewView instances, but not WebviewPanel.

---

## **Reproducibility**

* 100% reproducible
* Happens in a clean window
* Happens with multiple unrelated extensions
* Happens only on Insiders (Stable is unaffected)

---

## **Request**

Please investigate the interaction between:

* **Terminal panel activation**
* **WebviewView rendering / attach lifecycle**
* **ViewContainer layout manager in Insiders**

This issue breaks any extension that relies on WebviewView for sidebar or panel UI.

Happy to provide further logs or run experimental builds if needed.

With the latest update (version 1.106), the icons in the search bar received a refreshed look. Honestly, the new set is much less readable and efficient than the previous version. This update feels unnecessary and makes the search interface visually frustrating, especially for users who value clarity and speed.

Is there any way to switch back to the old icon style using app settings? If not, please consider adding this option: for users with a strong design background, the previous icons were simply better.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277109,0

3619543106,Extension host terminating on macOS with v1.106,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Upon open, I see an error stating: ""Extension host terminated unexpectedly 3 times within the last 5 minutes."" This happens instantly upon start. I am not sure how to reliably reproduce this issue. However, for context, before it began I was running vite and flask servers from a virtual environment, and I had to force restart while downloading an application. The issue began immediately after the restart.

Since then, I have tried: 
- Using the provided Extension Bisect tool which failed to find an extension
- Clearing my extensions
- Reinstalling VSCode
- Clearing associated VSCode files as done shown in step 3 of https://gist.github.com/karansinghgit/120ac7a5bee54430fed8a94b0fd6e426

And all attempts have failed. Any help fixing this would be much appreciated, and let me know if there is more information I should provide.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open any file with TODO comments.
2. Distracting inlays appear above each such comment.

<img width=""443"" height=""141"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d81d9de7-a7df-4436-a739-a8d1a9cd9c07"" />

It's very distracting - I tend to leave lots of TODOs for myself - and I can't find any way to disable it.

I tried clicking on it, right-clicking, or search in settings for ""Delegate to agent"" to disable them like you can for any other inlays - no results.

I don't understand where it's coming from. The closest I found is this PR https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/272524 which also mentions it would have settings to control it, but looks like that PR hasn't even been merged yet.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277046,0

... instead it asked endless questions, including asking after files included in the original prompt, and then said `I apologize that I cannot directly edit the files through the available tools.`
This was with Claude Haiku 4.5, after Auto presented one of those cryptic error messages.

1. 
2.




After the latest VS Code update, the **Default Dark+** theme looks completely different — Ruby and JavaScript keywords like `def`, `end`, `return` etc...,  lost their distinct purple color.

This was a core part of the theme’s readability and muscle memory for many developers. Please stop changing built-in theme colors without warning or provide a “Classic Dark+” toggle that restores the old look.

Also, can you please tell us **how to get the original Dark+ colors back right now**?

Type: <b>Bug</b>


while debugging my server, copilot ended up here:
>Let me kill all processes and try a different approach:
`pkill -9 node; pkill -9 -f ""mcp""; sleep 2`

**this unsafe and destructive instruction should never be executed despite having ""pkills"" in terminal allowed in general**

with that the whole vscode came down with errors. no idea what I've lost.

3609432646,VS Code Insiders Install/Registry Links Broken for all servers – Likely URL Encoding Issue,"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates -->
<!-- Please attach logs to help us diagnose your issue -->

### Summary

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdfbf927-7ac1-4c4e-8f0f-c2ac1bdafc76

Attempting to install a server from the Github MCP [registry](https://github.com/mcp) via the VS Code Insiders registry links currently always returns a 404 error. Investigation suggests this may be due to missing URL encoding in server name paths in the latest version of insiders.

### Context/References
- [Related blocking issue in copilot-ecosystem repo](https://github.com/github/copilot-ecosystem/issues/240)
- Install fails for available server (e.g. `serena`).
- Accessing any server directly fails unless the name is **URL encoded** (see [API docs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/guides/consuming/use-rest-api.md#:~:text=Server%20names%20and%20version%20strings%20should%20be%20URL%2Dencoded%20in%20paths.))
- Example that works: `https://api.mcp.github.com/v0.1/servers/oraios%2Fserena/versions` (note encoded `/`)

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Try to install any server from the VS Code Insiders UI or registry—results in 404.
2. Manually visit API URLs for servers *without* encoding: 404 returned.
3. Manually visit server API URL *with* encoding: succeeds.

### Recent Changes
- [Install button update](https://github.com/github/github-ui/pull/5257).

### Expected Behavior
- VS Code registry and Install UI properly encode server names and complete installs successfully.

### Environment
- VS Code Insiders Version: 1.106.0

### Logs
Deep link format for v0.1 (vscode-insiders:mcp/api.mcp.github.com/v0.1/servers/cognitionai%2Fdeepwiki/versions/latest) decodes the URL and doesn't re-encode:

We have been trying hard to reduce UX inconsistencies and I would love if we could improve this one.

This is not a full list of things I noticed but a good start:

**Explorer / Outline**

Notice how the twisties are not pixel perfect aligned vertically:

**Explorer / Search**

Notice how here also twistie is not pixel perfect aligned but also the distance from twistie to icon seems larger in search:

<img width=""600"" height=""918"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ffb19ea-8b4d-48d4-9c49-77a47db54e4e"" />

**Changes / Explorer**

Similar to above but here also the indentation of elements is a lot different, notice how first level icons are not aligned:

**Variables / Explorer**

The inconsistency drags on into debug land:

3603097730,Code incorrectly assumes `wsl.exe` outputs UTF-16LE when the `WSL_UTF8` environment variable is set,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Visual Studio Code seems to expect `wsl.exe` to output in UTF-16LE, which typically doesn't cause problems *unless* `WSL_UTF8=1` is set. In which case, `wsl.exe` outputs UTF-8 instead, causing distribution names to be interpreted incorrectly:

<img width=""1409"" height=""1077"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fa5d48e-5188-4d8c-ab59-03e9536c92f9"" />

To reproduce:

1. [Set up a WSL distribution.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Add a new user environment variable named `WSL_UTF8` with its value set to `1`.
3. Open Code, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` (Command Palette), and then type and enter `Create New Terminal (With Profile)` to look at the list of Terminal profiles.

The profiles ending in `(WSL)` should list the actual names for each distribution. Instead, they are incorrectly displayed as garbled text.

🐛 Its a markdown file, not sensitive at all.

🐛 Searching ""sensitive files"" in settings doesn't yield anything.

No idea where this glob comes from and how to fix that it shows up. Only option is tweaking the always allow button.

3594841342,Copilot bug. Chat history disappears when switching between projects,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I was working on some project in VS code with Copilot and I had a lot of chats with a lot of data. In the same VS Code window I have switched to another folder (i.e another project) and I got chats of the another projects. When I switched back to the original folder, all the Copilot chats dissapear and they are no longer available, I don't see the chat history in the list. The list is empty, this is a disaster

3593162235,Language Id and Alias name need to be updated in package.json,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

After I installed the `GitHub Copilot Chat` extension, I looked in my ""Language Modes"" picker to see if there were any new Language mode types.
In the list I see one of them created by the Chat extension:

_Screen clip showing this in the Language Modes picker..._
> <img width=""340"" height=""131"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47556405-7582-46f5-94b8-492500bd2b48"" />

_Screen clip showing this in the Chat extension's Features/Programming Languages view..._
> <img width=""560"" height=""210"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3ec61f-2f57-4b77-a1cb-b1f323d46dc6"" />

The issues here:
1. The `id` value has a capital letter : ""`(chatReplay)`""
   * This has been known to cause problems with other extensions or areas in VS Code that may _assume_ all Lang Ids are lowercase, but then do a case-sensitive lookup.  And in fact, looking at the other languages in the Lang Modes list, they all are indeed lowercase... _except this one_.
2. Both the display name/`alias` and the `id` values appear identical.
   * Digging into the `package.json`, it reveals that the 1st alias[0] (default one) is `chatReplay`, but alias[1] is `Chat Replay`.

Recommended Fixes:
1. Change the `""id"": ""chatReplay""` to `""id"": ""chatreplay""` (all lowercase).
2. Swap the order of the alias values so it is `""aliases"": [ ""Chat Replay"", ""chatReplay"" ]`

Notes:
* You may need to double-check other dependency references that use the Language by id and update those to all lowercase as appropriate.

Sample of the existing Chat Replay entry in package.json under languages:
```json
{ ""id"": ""chatReplay"",
  ""aliases"": [ ""chatReplay"", ""Chat Replay"" ],
  ""extensions"": [ "".chatReplay.json"", "".chatreplay.json"" ]
}
```

Proposed sample after fixes (_not including other potential dependencies_):
```json
{ ""id"": ""chatreplay"",
  ""aliases"": [ ""Chat Replay"", ""chatReplay"" ],
  ""extensions"": [ "".chatReplay.json"", "".chatreplay.json"" ]
}
```

After I made these changes locally, the VSCode's ""Language Modes"" list item for ""Chat Replay"" looks more like it should be.

This is because these APIs that we hit for this feature require more scopes from the token then we are giving:

because of the usage of `getAnyGitHubSession`, a `user:email` only scoped token is being used to call these APIs and I'm gonna guess that they need more than that. The auth service has a `getPermissiveToken` that should have the token needed, but I think this feature should probably follow what the `@github` agent does:

The issue is about VS Code not allowing Copilot Chat extension (and possibly other AI extensions) to proceed in Terminal when some commands/scripts are finished. The point of **""Press any key to continue ...""** is being taken as not finished yet, and requires the human user to press to proceed.

This is a blocker for the autonomic functioning of the affected AI agent, and if this condition is hit multiple times per session, will significantly slow down the user's workflow. Imagine going AFK for a while and returning to discover it has only just began the task (and became blocked, - paused - on this), to then have to sit next to it to manually continue on further occasions throughout the task. Not everyone has their view settings to always show the Terminal console.

<img width=""244"" height=""367"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2d1bc3-fafb-4f5c-81f8-788d2d9a86d1"" />

**Crucially, as you can see, the terminal session's in-progress spinner is still running the circle, so the agent doesn't consider it as done.** If the user doesn't bother to click it, open it, and spot that it was just waiting for user keystroke like Enter, he'd have never found out why the Agent was stuck indefinitely and would never be completing their task.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Use Copilot Agent Chat and wait for it to need to run an affected PowerShell, .bat or .cmd command/script
2. Observe the whole Agent flow being stuck due to ""Press any key to continue ..."" being prompted in Terminal Window, hidden or retrievable by clicking the Agent window's active terminal session.

It can occur with many types of queries, commands and scripts, which are called by the AI agent extension's available tools. The degree of an user being affected depends on if they work with solutions that require the use of the impacted commands. I am affected because i let the AI agent rebuild my program, as you can see in the screenshot.

To fix this issue, VS Code must let extensions like GitHub Copilot automatically send a keystroke (or internal proceed-now) when the text ""Press any key to continue ..."" is detected in one of the agent's active terminal sessions.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/275605,0

Two things:

- 🐛 The description mentions `replacementRange` can be `undefined`, but the typing makes it impossible.
- 🐛 If `undefined` is indeed possible, the same documentation should be in the `constructor` option, as well as the correct type.

Nevertheless, I find the `readonly [number, number]` to be rather confusing, especially since there's no such property in `TerminalCompletionContext` that would directly map to it. I am force to do this today:

```ts
new vscode.TerminalCompletionItem(""HELLO"", [context.cursorIndex, context.cursorIndex])
```

3588736501,"Inconsistent/inaccurate naming of Copilot ""Configure Inline Suggestions..."" quickpick menu","Testing #274837
Tested on WSL

## Background info

Next to the ""Toggle Chat"" button, one can access a menu item to ""Configure Inline Suggestions...""
<img width=""381"" height=""256"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14e22466-3d41-42c0-9518-ca3bd546111d"" />

When that quickpick opens, the title of the quickpick is ""Configure Copilot Completions"" which might look like this:

<img width=""614"" height=""208"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07e4c1a6-1c27-481e-a5c6-b4118c912217"" />

Or sometimes have a ""Disable Completions"" item like this:

<img width=""619"" height=""233"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddfaf743-daa9-4266-be62-ce3c4c397381"" />

## Issues
* There's inconsistent naming: In one label it's called ""Configure Inline Suggestions..."" and in another label it's called ""Configure Copilot Completions""
* Both of those labels are misleading, because this quickpick is not only about completions. The Keyboard Shortcuts and Settings that are accessed through this quick pick are general for everything related to Copilot. The Diagnostics are for Copilot Chat. The documentation link is for Copilot in general.

So, I would suggest updating the label ""Configure Inline Suggestions..."" to be something more representative of what this quickpick menu contains. For example, it could be renamed to ""Configure Copilot..."". Similarly, I would suggest updating the title of the quickpick to match the naming used in the menu item.",bug,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/275443,0

A few thoughts:
- Why was this task too complex? Could we provide a bit more context over how the decision was made? 
     - Otherwise, I might wonder when I would use inline chat, since I thought this task (defining a term) would be a good candidate
- Should we consider a different phrasing for `Continue in Chat`?
     - Would `Continue in Panel` or `Continue in Panel Chat` make sense?
- `Don't ask again` looks slightly misaligned with its checkbox (text is below the box)

I used the History Item Reference Picker to select `main` and `origin/main` of the workespace through which I contribute to VS Code. Normally it is set to `Auto` and its tip reports it is showing `main`, `origin/main` and `upstream/main`.

3585852135,"Copilot Chat incorrectly handle files in symlinked workspace folders as ""outside of workspace"" on WSL","- Copilot Chat Extension Version: **0.32.4**

- VS Code Version: **1.105.1**

- OS Version: Windows 11 with WSL2 (Ubuntu)

- Feature: **Agent Mode ONLY**

- Selected model: GPT-4.1 (copilot)

### Logs:
[Please paste logs here. You can get them by opening the VS Code ""Output"" pane and selecting ""GitHub Copilot Chat"" from the dropdown menu.]

### Steps to Reproduce:
Set up Environment: Work within a WSL2 instance on a Windows machine.
Create Symlinked Directory: Create a project folder on the Windows filesystem (e.g., C:\\Data\\wsl\\share\\my-project). In your WSL terminal, create a symbolic link to this folder (e.g., ln -s /mnt/c/Data/wsl/share/ ~/dev).
Open Project in VS Code: Open the project in VS Code by accessing it through the symbolic link. For example, run code ~/dev/my-project from the WSL terminal. The workspace folder in VS Code will be the symlinked path (e.g., [oracle](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/GS8630/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html)).
Use Copilot Agent: Start a chat in **AGENT MODE** and ask it to edit a file within the project. For example: 

<img width=""397"" height=""954"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57f118fd-474b-4024-8dea-8bac8e6abc27"" />

Observe the Error: Copilot Chat will prompt with a security warning.

### Expected Behavior :
Copilot should recognize that the file path is within the currently opened workspace and perform the edit without a security prompt, as the canonical path of the file is inside the workspace folder.

### Actual Behavior :
Copilot displays a security prompt: ""Allow edits to sensitive files?""

It incorrectly identifies the file as being outside the workspace. The path it displays is a malformed, Windows-style path that seems to incorrectly resolve the WSL symlink:

\\home\\gtec\\dev\\ansible\\collections\\oracle\\.github\\chatmodes\\oracle.chatmode.md

This happens even though the actual file path within VS Code and WSL is a valid Linux-style path:

/home/gtec/dev/ansible/collections/oracle/.github/chatmodes/oracle.chatmode.md

Github copilot agent doesn't seem to want to run powershell commands on my arm-based copilot laptop:

```
Tried to launch mvn clean install, but the VS Code shell integration returned powershell grammar is not supported on arm or arm64, so I couldn’t execute it here. Could you run the command locally and share any output or errors? I’ll help interpret the results once we have them.

3583031232,"Does not follow instructions in copilot-instructions.md after ""Summarize Conversation""","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I have a block of instructions related to code security rules regarding SQL injection that I had copilot add to the instructions document and it sounds exactly like what I want it to do.  But it REGULARLY ignores those instructions. In this instace, it went through and changed the SECURE code into the INSECURE way of building SQL that is strictly forbidden by the rules. It often seem to ignore the whole instructions once it ""summarized conversations"" but this could be a correlation and not a causation. But it wrote the code correctly and then after summarizing the conversation, it changed the working secure coding into insecure code.

3. hit `Cmd+I`

=> nothing happens

In stable, this would close inline chat. We can either do that, or open inline chat at the cursor location?

3582416917,"Terminal Tab Icons Display Scrollbar Despite Sufficient Vertical Space, Hiding Icons","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

When users create multiple terminals (three or more) in VS Code's terminal region, the terminal icons display on the right side with a scrollbar appearing even though there is sufficient vertical space available in the panel. The scrollbar prevents all terminal icons from being fully visible and accessible at once, requiring unnecessary scrolling to view or switch between terminals.

3581841012,"Erro ao usar a opção ""Agent""","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Bom dia,
Até uns 5 dias atrás eu estava conseguindo usar o Agent para executar um servidor MCP. Do nada o chat do Github Copilot no modo Agente parou de funcionar e passou a apresentar o erro:

No lowest priority node found (path: zye) (at tsx element Dg)

O problema não está no servidor MCP, pois eu consigo usa-lo em outras IDEs, como por exemplo o Cursor.

### Description

When attempting to generate a Git commit message using GitHub Copilot Chat, the extension fails with an error indicating it cannot resolve the chat model ""gpt-5-mini"".

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Make changes to files in a Git repository
2. Open the Source Control view
3. Click the sparkle icon to generate a commit message using Copilot
4. Error occurs immediately

### Expected Behavior

The extension should generate a commit message using an available chat model (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-3.5).

### Actual Behavior

The extension throws an error and fails to generate the commit message.

### Error Message

```

```

### Environment

- **VS Code Version:** VS Code Insiders (latest)
- **GitHub Copilot Chat Extension Version:** 0.33.2025103002
- **OS:** macOS
- **GitHub Copilot Subscription:** [Your subscription type - Individual/Business/Enterprise]

### Additional Context

- The model ""gpt-5-mini"" does not appear to be a valid or available model
- No custom model configuration is set in user settings
- The extension appears to be hardcoded or misconfigured to request this non-existent model family
- Other Copilot Chat features work normally; only commit message generation is affected

### Workaround Attempted

None successful. The feature is completely broken with this extension version.

### Related Settings

3579894151,Order of grouped tools,"I noticed that with virtual tool grouping, the first tool in my request is `mcp_github_search_repositories`. This is less optimal for prompt caching because you can get a cache hit on just some of your tools (at least on gpt models). So previously I sorted built-in tools to the top, and they are sorted for all users in a predictable way:

3719511321,"`Error while reading the extension cache file` even when using ""Rebuild without cache""  (and deleting everything in docker)","Sometimes I get the error `Error while reading the extension cache file`  while loading a dev container.  It says it's trying to read an extension cache file, so I then select to rebuilt without cache but... it still tries to read a cache file, so clearly the ""without cache"" bit is being ignored here.   I also tried deleting the container in docker, and also all the associated images and volumes, so it should (unless I'm missing somewhere..) be a completely fresh build (note that I'd expect that ""rebuild without cache"" wouldn't be affected by deleting any of that stuff anyway but), and yet the issue still persists.  

I can't find any obvious info about where this file _should_ come from, or why vs code thinks it should exist when it doesn't (which makes sense since there's supposed to be no cache).

Eventually after a day or two of bashing my head against a wall trying everything possible it'll somehow go away, but I haven't been able to figure out why; and similarly I can't figure out what I'm doing to cause it- my actions prior don't seem out of the ordinary.

(note, in case it helps diagnosis:  I was doing a lot of rebuilds because for some reason I can't get `postCreateCommand`, `postStartCommand`, etc to run (again, even after a rebuild and deleting the container + images), maybe there's some system/configuration issue that's causing both issues?)

      ## Features

      - **Subscriber Analytics**: View real-time subscriber counts, growth trends, and engagement metrics
      - **Form Management**: Monitor form performance, view submissions, and embed forms
      - **Tag Management**: Create, view, and manage subscriber tags
      - **Subscriber Details**: Access detailed subscriber information including custom fields
      - **Push Notifications**: Receive real-time alerts for subscriber events, purchases, and email bounces
      - **Secure Authentication**: API key storage using iOS Keychain

      ## Requirements

      - iOS 15.0+
      - Xcode 14.0+
      - Swift 5.7+
      - ConvertKit account with API credentials

      ## Installation

      1. Clone the repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kitty.git
      cd kitty
      ```

      2. Open the project in Xcode:
      ```bash
      open Kitty.xcodeproj
      ```

      3. Build and run the project (⌘R)

      ## Configuration

      ### ConvertKit API Keys

      1. Get your API credentials from [ConvertKit Settings](https://app.convertkit.com/account_settings/advanced_settings)
      2. Launch the app and enter your:
         - **API Key** (public key for read operations)
         - **API Secret** (for authenticated operations)

      ### Push Notifications (Optional)

      To receive push notifications for ConvertKit events:

      1. Enable push notifications when prompted
      2. The app will automatically configure webhooks with ConvertKit
      3. Notifications are delivered via the relay server at `lenskit.rebornix.com`

      ## Architecture

      ### Tech Stack

      - **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
      - **Combine**: Reactive programming for data flow
      - **URLSession**: Native networking
      - **Keychain**: Secure credential storage
      - **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring

      ### Project Structure

      ```

      ```

      ### Key Components

      - **ConvertKitViewModel**: Central state manager using `@Published` properties
      - **ConvertKitAPI**: Singleton service with Combine publishers for reactive networking
      - **Modular API Extensions**: Focused files for forms, subscribers, tags, notifications, and summaries

      ## API Integration

      The app integrates with ConvertKit's REST API v3:

      - Base URL: `https://api.convertkit.com/v3/`
      - Rate limit: 120 requests per 60 seconds
      - Authentication: API key/secret via query parameters

      Supported endpoints:
      - Account validation
      - Forms and form subscriptions
      - Subscribers and custom fields
      - Tags and tagging
      - Webhook management
      - Summary statistics

      ## Development

      ### Running Tests

      ```bash
      # Run unit tests
      xcodebuild test -scheme Kitty -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'

      # Or use Xcode Test Navigator (⌘6)
      ```

      ### Error Tracking

      The app uses Sentry for error tracking. Errors are automatically captured and reported with relevant context.

3576076383,Merge editor synced scrolling fails with word wrap enabled,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Merge editor synced scrolling fails with word wrap enabled

In the merge editor the scrolling is synced between the current and incoming change views based on the content not the line number, when word wrapping is enabled this fails and changes are no longer shown side by side.

To reproduce just open the merge editor for a conflict of a file where in one of the changes (current or incoming but not both) has added a lot of long lines, then turn on word wrapping and observe how scroll locking is offset by the amount of lines that are wrapped.

To prevent that the ~/.vscode/extensions path is used in that case, I tried to use the "" --extensionHomePath"" in the extensionHost launch config and specify an empty directory.
But it seems that the ""--extensionHomePath"" isn't honoured in this case (probably because vscode is a proxy that connects to an already running vscode).

117704638,Regression: editor text is blurry on Linux with 125% text scaling,"Using Arch Linux with Gnome/Gtk+ 3.18.

In versions 0.9.2 and below, VS Code ignored the text scaling factor in Gnome 3 and rendered its UI text at 100% scale instead of 125% as I had set. (The text scaling factor can be set with gnome-tweak-tool.) To compensate, I set the editor text size to 17, which worked fine.

As of 0.10.1, VS Code now seems to respect the text scaling factor. However, the editor text is noticeably blurry. Changing the editor text size or font does not help. The UI text, on the other hand, seems to be rendered correctly.

117778114,Goto definition acts too early in some cases,"When pressing the mouse button down then holding control and then releasing the mouse button, VS Code jumps to the definition. This should only happen if you are holding down CTRL before the mouse down.

One of the problems this causes: When selecting text and copying/cutting/pasting it via CTRL+X/C/V you have to be sure to let go of the mouse button before you press CTRL.

Another issue with CTRL is that when navigating through recent files with CTRL+TAB and you go backwards in the list via CTRL+SHIFT+TAB, but then decide you actually didn't need to go backwards: You release SHIFT and get immediately thrown into the currently selected file. I think this should only happen when letting go of CTRL in that case.

In my opinion the Jump To Definition probably shouldn't happen regardless of modifier keys pressed when you have a text selection created with that mouse action.

Its a minor nuisance that when saving a new file, it always defaults to ""Untitled-[X].txt"" with Save as type set to ""Plain Text"". Therefore if you specify an extension and dont change the dropdown to all files (or correct type) it will save it like SampleFile.js.txt.

Propose that untitled files default to just ""Untitled-[X]"" with no extension and save as type set to all files.

Appears to be as simple as removing the mime type suggesestion in [/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/untitledEditorInput.ts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/untitledEditorInput.ts#L78)

118902377,Cannot delete .asar file while VS Code is open,"Hi!

It looks like VS Code opens `.asar` files to make them browsable in the workspace tree view. That sounds helpful, except it seems like a file handle is kept open at all times, preventing some packaging script of mine from deleting `.asar` files if I keep VS Code open when running it.

Would it be possible to ensure `.asar` files are only opened by VS Code if they are being browsed explicitely in the tree view? or maybe avoid keeping the file handle open on them while idling?

I'm running VS Code 0.10.2 on Windows 7 64-bit.
Thanks for a great editor! ♥

Thanks for your product, I really enjoy using it. However I have one problem:
When using ES6 features, like the arrow functions, I get the message ""This can only be used with ES6. Make sure to have a jsconfig.json-file which sets the target to ES6"".

However I have a `jsconfig.json`-file in my root (the folder opened in Visual Studio Code), which contains:

``` json
{
    ""compilerOptions"": {
        ""target"": ""ES6"",
        ""module"": ""commonjs""
    }
}
```

The weird part is that I get it for some files, and not for others. Even if the files are in the same directory. Right now I have three files in the subdirectory `/app/bpm` names `bpm.js`, `bpmController.js` and `enterClick.js`. All three are written with ES6-functionality, but I only get the warning and red underlined text for `bpm.js`. 

UPDATE:
I just restarted VS Code, and the red underline disappeared from `bpm.js` too. It was a new file I had created after the two others, however the red underline only went away after a restart.

Problem: publishing an extension with the same name but a different publisher ID creates a new extension that has nothing to do with the original extension.
The debug UI code that collects the extension does not seem to detect the problem that a debug type is redefined. Subsequently it is not clear what debug adapter extension is actually used.

I suggest, that we support that debug adapter extensions for an existing debug type but with a different publisher are allowed but result in a warning.

We also see this when you Cmd+Q the extension host to terminate the session.

If I run the Code program from my normal ssh login it runs waits a while and then exits, with no error message or anything.
If I run it with the sudo Code command it runs up and works fine, apart from the whole running as root issue :(.
I suspect it's a file permission thing but am unable to track down what it could be.

119977287,Comparing a number variable to a string shows a warning even though assigning a string is perfectly fine,"Consider the following example:

```
function myFunc(myString) {
    let myVar = Infinity;
    myVar = myString.substring(1);
    if(myVar == 'ello') {

    }
}
```

This will show a warning at the `if` statement saying the `==`  operator can't be used to compare a string and a number. Aside from the discussion whether this should be done in the first place, I think we can agree that it's handled inconsistently here: if we can assign a string to a number just fine then comparing a string to a number should be okay as well (and certainly if we use `==` instead of `===`).

120515647,Locally exported environment variables are overwritten by ~/.bash_profile when using `code .`,"Per https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/141, there appears to still be an issue with how env vars are passed into Code, even after the fix for https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/560.

Steps to reproduce:
1. have `export FOO=1` in your `.bash_profile`
2. ensure your function to start visual studio code looks like this `code () { VSCODE_CWD=""$PWD"" open -n -b ""com.microsoft.VSCode"" --args $* ;}`
3.  open a terminal session
4.  `export FOO=2` in your terminal session
5.  open `code .`
6. open developer tools, and eval `process.env[""FOO""]`

Expected: `Foo` should be `2`
Result: `FOO` will be `1`

But the thing that's really odd is that if you skip step (1) (remove this from you `.bash_profile`), you will see `Foo` set to `2`.  So in that case, the local environment is getting passed in.  

It seems like this must be either a problem with how vscode is setting up the env vars, or how `open` in OS X behaves.

I found a minor issue with typescript debugging. When executing a typescript program, breakpoints placed on the first line of static methods are moved to the closing brace of the method. 

For example:

``` typescript
import fs = require('fs');

class MyClass {
  public static doSomethingStatic(): void {
    let a: boolean = fs.existsSync('a');
    let b: boolean = fs.existsSync('b');
    let c: boolean = fs.existsSync('c');
  }
}

MyClass.doSomethingStatic();
```

Breakpoints on line `b`, `c` work as expected, but putting a breakpoint on line `a` does not work: the breakpoint gets moved to the closing brace `}`.

The problem is not present in non-static methods.

The reason is that these values mean that the settings will be ""gussed"" based on the current opened file. The guessing code is limited in cases where the file does not give sufficient hints and causes surprise to end users when some files resolve to `insertSpaces: true` and some to `insertSpaces: false` in a seemingly unpredictable manner.

We have decided to change the defaults to `tabSize: 4, insertSpaces: true` as this seems to be the most common used setting and because most of the compilers can handle spaces, while some compilers do not like tabs.

> I just updated VSCode to the latest version (0.10.3) and reduced this problem to a small case, and I'm really confused:
> 1. A simple internal module, a simple .d.ts referencing it. Everything works fine: http://i.imgur.com/O8uIQFT.png

2. I create a plain .js file. Even without writing to it or saving it again, I get Schrodinger's interface: http://i.imgur.com/siOf1AV.png

![](http://i.imgur.com/siOf1AV.png)

> At this point, the errors about the interface file won't go away. After I close the .js file in the editor, close the folder, and reopen the folder, things go back to normal. But as soon as I open a plain .js file, they come back just like before. After the errors get triggered, I can close the .js file and they stay in the status bar. If I then add both the module and the .d.ts to the ""working files"" list, then remove .d.ts from it, the errors vanish again.

We're not sure what sort of interaction might be going on with the TypeScript language service, so we felt it would be better filed here.

```

Using the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> key, navigate from the beginning of the line to its end. As you jump over the Chinese character, you'll notice that it takes two key presses to get away from it. Additionally, if you type some latin text between those two jumps, the content of the line from that position until the end fully disappears. You are creating bytes from within the double-byte Chinese character, effectively generating invalid Unicode sequences.

- when pressing <kbd>7</kbd>, the `keydown` event we receive has `keyCode:55`

- when pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd>, the `keydown` we receive has `shiftKey:true` and `keyCode: 191`
  - this is unexpected, we should receive `shiftKey:true` and `keyCode:55`

In the dark theme (and light theme), CSS at-rules (e.g. @font-face) were coloured purple, distinguishing them from regular selectors.

See @font-face in the screenshot (note @keyframes is not highlighted at all in stable, but it probably isn't known in css.plist or Intellisense)

Also, Unknown keywords when used as property values (e.g. keywords known by IntelliSense like the local keyword for background-attachment, but not known by the CSS.plist highlighter) are now not coloured (white) rather than a orange/red like before.

Typescript suggestions are always out of sync whenever any change like a git operation happens. 
For someone like me who relies on the terminal, the experience is horrible.
If I understand it correctly, it's caused by changes to files outside the IDE. ""atom-typescript"" had a sync button to fix this. You should too.

122375886,Extensibility API: openTextDocument() inconsistent dirty state with working files if document is inside workspace.rootPath,"Sorry for the convoluted title, also sorry if this is simply user error or misuse of the API.

Long story short, I'm opening the TextDocument like this:

```
vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(vscode.Uri.parse(""untitled:"" + lsFullpath)).then(...);
```

where lsFullpath is a full path inside vscode.workspace.rootPath, and immediately call

```
TextDocument.save()
```

This has the intended effect (which might be the API misuse) that a new file (and required non-existent subfolders) is created in the workspace.

However, the working files now have the new file with a dirty marker.

Also, browsing to the file in the workspace (not working files) and opening in the editor and changing it creates a 2nd entry in working files, obviously also dirty at this point.

Saving the file removes dirty marker from the 2nd entry in working files, but changes are not propagated to the 1st entry.

Now selecting 1st entry in working files and saving it kicks out 2nd entry from working files, and overwrites the file (which I guess is to be expected).

This came up trying for a quick solution for #1169

122448583,[css] cssParser incomplete for at-rules,"Few of issues I’ve seen in the parser for at-rules:
- @supports flagged as unknown at-rule. https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-3/#at-supports . This is supported by all browsers now.
- @-ms-keyframes isn't flagged. This never existed. It is added [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/languages/css/common/parser/cssParser.ts#L480) . There is a note below saying it [doesn't exist](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/languages/css/common/parser/cssParser.ts#L487) but this code doesn't seem to do anything. Removing L480 above fixes it, but I don't know if there should be a more specific error message to show that the prefix was never needed and thus is redundant?
- For @viewport the method is named _parseMSViewPort instead of _parseViewPort, and only includes the -ms- version. Opera Presto (so Opera Mini still) [supports @-o-viewport](https://dev.opera.com/articles/an-introduction-to-meta-viewport-and-viewport/) and it is a good idea to allow the unprefixed version for forwards compatibility. It is supported behind a flag in Chrome/Opera 15+.
- Same issue as above for @document, except the method name is named more generically.
- @counter-style missing. Supported by Firefox (33+). This could hit the two browser rule, but @document is included.
- Same as above for  @font-feature-values. Firefox 34+.

of the new ones, @supports is probably the most critical to fix as it is widely supported now and we'd like to promote it as a better alternative to UA detection for CSS.

Most of these including all @keyframes also don't syntax highlight properly (beyond general broken CSS highlighting in the insider release), but I can look to fix that in CSS.plist separate from this.

122677100,How to get custom sort order for CompletionItem list,"I'm working on the PowerShellEditorServices support and right now the ordering for cmdlet parameters is alphabetical.  In PowerShell this is typically not what you want as there are a dozen or so ""common"" parameters that automatically show up on every cmdlet i.e. PowerShell provides them for all cmdlets.  

So in editors like PowerShell ISE it is common to list the cmdlet-specific parameters first followed by the common parameters.  I thought I could use CompletionItem.SortText to get a custom sort order but it doesn't seem to be working.  Here's a log of the messages returned to VSCode for this list:

``` json
{
    ""label"": ""-FileVersionInfo"",
    ""kind"": 10,
    ""detail"": null,
    ""documentation"": null,
    ""sortText"": ""007-FileVersionInfo"",
    ""filterText"": ""Regular Parameter"",
    ""insertText"": null,
    ""textEdit"": {
    ""range"": {
        ""start"": {
        ""line"": 49,
        ""character"": 12
        },
        ""end"": {
        ""line"": 49,
        ""character"": 13
        }
    },
    ""newText"": ""-FileVersionInfo""
    },
    ""data"": null
},
{
    ""label"": ""-ErrorAction"",
    ""kind"": 10,
    ""detail"": null,
    ""documentation"": null,
    ""sortText"": ""008-ErrorAction"",
    ""filterText"": ""Common Parameter"",
    ""insertText"": null,
    ""textEdit"": {
    ""range"": {
        ""start"": {
        ""line"": 49,
        ""character"": 12
        },
        ""end"": {
        ""line"": 49,
        ""character"": 13
        }
    },
    ""newText"": ""-ErrorAction""
    },
    ""data"": null
},
```

Kind should be CompletionItemKind.Variable.  I was experimenting with other kinds to see if they worked any better - no joy so far.

Also it is not clear from the documentation how you use FilterText and what it looks like in the UI.

When making a quick find next, by highlighting some text then pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>, the search box receives focus making it hard to do quick changes to the found matches. 

The same thing happens when having a previous search then pressing <kbd>F3</kbd>.

While doing this, I notice that I can search for `vscode-eslint` in the Install Extensions dialog. I find the correct extension, but the results pane does not show me the `vscode-eslint` that I searched for (`name` in `package.json`). It shows `displayName`, `description`, `version`, and `publisher`.

I was left wondering if that was the right package, because it said `ESLint`, and I couldn't see `vscode-eslint` anywhere.

In the case where a user searches on `name`, and VS Code finds a match, if the results pane contained feedback that the package listed is the right package, it would be good. 

An idea: Maybe show `name` in the results if the match was on `name`?

I've attached a screen shot - hope that clarifies what I'm talking about. 

Thanks!

In general I think that we should not show warnings in this way because it is annoying and unhelpful. Instead we should show warning (later ""error"") squigglies in the json editor and offer intellisense to help the user inserting the missing ""${workspaceRoot}"" and have a ""light bulb"" action for fixing the whole launch json (as an example use the validation that got introduced for the Keyboard Shortcuts json).

123513841,"Changes in line endings are not correctly reflected in the extension host, leading to invalid offsets sent to external refactoring tools","See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/165 for how this was discovered and how it effects the go extension, where I initially encountered the problem (reproduction instructions are available in [this comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/165#issuecomment-166618653)).

In short: since the `gorename` tool seems to always convert the document's line endings to `LF`, running it once when the endings are initially `CRLF` may seem to work at first, but at the second time, (when the endings are changed to `LF`) since the extension host still calculates offsets based on `CRLF` the tool would give what seemed like 'strange' errors about invalid offsets that didn't seem to make sense at first. Changing line endings using the UI itself didn't seem to matter, but reopening the file 'magically' fixed it.

Tracing this into the vscode source: in `extHostDocuments.ts`, within the `BaseTextDocument` class it seems like the [`_eol` property](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L185) is not updated when the line endings change. This means that the [`offsetAt` function](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L185) may return invalid values. Fixing this might not be sufficient. In order to force the [`_ensureLineStarts` function](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L329) to recalculate the line offsets it seems that the [`_lineStarts` object](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/70ee90dcc1c9a3094ae2ba94f8d0c210a72e499e/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDocuments.ts#L190) needs to be reset every time that the line endings change (this includes cases where they are changed by an external tool or editor). I would recommend this should also handle the case where only a _single_ (or some) line ending changes (meaning the line endings are inconsistent), as in some rare cases some external tools may modify the text in this way.

```

When I try to reference this image in html it appears as a broken image:

```

123742211,Tab in CSS editor after colon creates errant autocomplete,"**Bug:** When editing a CSS file, using the tab key after a colon inserts the characters `:;` rather than actually inserting the tab. Similar expansion bugs occur when pressing tab before the colon, or after any selector.

**What should happen:** a tab character should be inserted, or if the user has chosen to expand tabs to spaces, the appropriate number of spaces.

**Steps to reproduce:**
Enter the following code in a CSS file:

``` css
div {
    font-size:12pt;
}
```

Position the cursor after the `:` and hit the tab key. Rather than `12pt` moving to the right, an extra `:;` is inserted.

**Platform:** OS X 10.11.2, Visual Studio Code 0.10.5.

I've tested this in Windows 10 on Visual Studio Community Edition, and it behaves as expected.

A couple users of the PowerShell extension have discovered that this variable will have the file path of the first opened file in the workspace.  However, if they switch active files this variable does not change, meaning that the debugger will always run that first file.  See more discussion here:

https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/commit/a613d5eafa2f014ce0b2b5b857eb60d4e6d11fb8

It would be nice if this variable got updated dynamically so that the user can run the debugger against the currently active file without having to manually edit their `launch.json` file each time.  This is a pretty common practice when developing PowerShell scripts.

For example, use the tasks.json from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29987840/how-to-execute-python-code-from-within-visual-studio-code, except make it a test command or build command so you can run with a shortcut. Run on an app.py file containing some error, like it only contains the code `1.foo`.

The problem matcher defined in the task.json only works with single line error output, but Python delivers multiline output. I assume this is what is causing VSCode to freeze. It (at least for me) can't be closed except by killing the process.

124613485,"insertSpaces = auto, new file, first indentation, tab not possible.","When `insertSpaces = auto` is set and you create a new file, pressing the tab key will insert spaces rather than a tab character.  This is a problematic default because it means there is no easy way to actually get the first tab into the file so the `auto` can start learning what the file's indentation mechanism is.  If you want space indent, you can simply press the space bar a few times to start the learning process.  In order to start a new file with tab indentation though you (currently) need to go find another file with a tab in it, copy the tab, and paste it into the new file.

I recommend having the fallback behavior for an empty file be that the space bar inserts spaces and the tab key inserts tabs.  This way both camps (spaces and tabs) have the ability to reasonably start new files when in auto-mode.

At first I thought it was a problem with the node-native-keymap but when I try it it gives me the correct binding:

```
...

Not being able to bind that key makes it more or less impossible to use any vim-extensions since the `<` is used to indent.

I feel that if the file on the disk and file opened on code is in same state it should automatically reflect the changes made on the disk. This is what every modern text  editor do.
Here is how to reproduce it.
- Create a text file.
- Open the file in Sublime text, Bracket and Code. In this situation the file is blank in all 3 editors.
- In Sublime text, write ""Hello"". Then save.
- Switch to Bracket, You will see ""Hello"".
- Switch to Code, you will see blank.
- Now again switch to Bracket, write ""Hello world"". Then save.
- Switch to Sublime text, You will see ""Hello world"".
- Switch to Code, you will see blank.

In both cases Code should reflect the changes made on disk.

When editing simple JS files (although not tried with other languages), if I double click a word (to highlight it) and then start tying (i.e. to replace it), it sometimes ignores my typing.

I'm using the standard dark theme and I have noticed that when this is the case, the highlight is a slightly different colour to the normal editable selected text highlight.

I have also noticed that is happens more often if I double click quickly on a word, as opposed to if I double click more slowly.

I have a feeling that because this is running on Electron and essentially some kind of web application, maybe there is a race condition of sorts where if I double click too fast, the electron framework detects a select ""span element"" as opposed to the editor detecting that I'm highlighting a word for editing.

It might be a bug in the underlying Electron framework and not VS Code itself, but I have no idea, just suggesting. I have asked a friend who uses Atom on the same setup as me (also uses Electron) and he says he can't replicate, but he did say he uses a plugin which highlights the same words as the selected word (https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected).

For additional information that might be of relevance in reproducing the issue, I am using VS Code 0.10.6 (latest release), Mac OS X (version 10.10.5), using the application in full screen mode (i.e. Command+Ctrl+F) and using an external USB mouse.

125414201,Extremely slow loading and operation,"Initial loading of VS Code can take between 10 and 20 seconds.
The `Reload Window` command takes about 10 seconds to complete.

I've tried it from the installer and also building from source with similar problems.

CPU profiling shows `ChildProcess.spawn` is the biggest problem, which calls all the way down to `node.js _tickCallback`.  I'd be happy to email someone the profile if it would help.

I suppose this issue could be with node itself?  I'm at a loss, since VS Code works perfectly on my home computers which have no proxy.

125441471,"F3, Find Next, acts like ""Find Under Cursor""","tl; dr: F3 acts like Ctrl+F3 in Visual Studio
##### More details:

Let's say the text editor contains the following 4 lines:

```
ABC
ABC
XYZ
ABC
```

The cursor is at the very top, of the file, at the first ABC.  I hit Ctrl+F to show the Find dialog.  I type ABC.  The first ABC is highlighted.  I hit Esc to exit the Find dialog.
The cursor is now at end of the first line, with ABC on that line highlighted.  I hit delete to remove it and change the text to XYZ.   At this point the text editor looks like this:

```
XYZ
ABC
XYZ
ABC
```

The cursor is at end of the first line.

I hit F3 to ""Find Next"" to find the next occurrence of ABC, but instead it searches for XYZ.  The reason is because hitting F3 changes what's being searched for.   In other words, F3 acts like Ctrl+F3 in Visual Studio

125600857,Installing an extension with multiple Code instances open,"A colleague showed me something interesting today.

He said he had multiple VS Code windows open (in Mac OS X) and installed an extension. He was notified that the installation was successful and that he should restart, so he clicked the restart button. As expected, the VS Code window closed and reopened and the extension was available.

However, he then switched to another VS Code window and saw that his newly installed extension was unavailable.

We noticed it was because clicking the restart button only restarts the active VS Code window, not all of them. So you might still have other CS Code windows that do not get the extension until they are manually restarted.

What might potentially make this more complicated is that VS Code has the session restore setting and the default is to restore only 1 window. So if you kill all code processes and relaunch code, and the user had multiple open when they installed the extension, then by default only 1 of them will ""restart"" and the rest will remain closed.

It might be an idea to temporarily change the editor setting to restore all, then kill all code processes and relaunch, then change the setting back... or maybe that's a terrible idea, but hey it's a suggestion!

125768845,VS Code with NVM,"Hi, thank you for great app.

So, I hope VS Code sets specified environment variables when it starts.
I use a NodeJS Version Manager such as nvm, then a path to NodeJS is not added to `PATH` until nvm do it. (Also `NODE_PATH`, `NODE_HOME`, etc.)
That is, CLI of modules such as Gulp, Grunt, UglifyJS, etc. are not work as Task of VS Code. (VS Code can't find out these.)

When I add to `PATH` a path to these CLIs such as `/path/to/nvm/v4.2.4` and call `code` command, these Tasks work fine. Or when I add a following line to `VS Code DIRECTORY/bin/code.js`.

``` js
process.env['PATH'] += require('path').delimiter + '/path/to/nvm/v4.2.4';
```

But, When VS Code is started from launcher such as Windows Start Menu, these are not work because `Code.exe` is called directly.

As everyone knows, NodeJS is updated frequently. A better solution I think is that VS Code sets environment variables written in `settings.json` that was specified by user. Or user is given a chance such as ""Startup Script(or Command)"" to do something.

125837701,tasks.json support buggy?,"I have the tasks.json file below.  I wish there was an integrated deploy task, and that we could natively have multiple top-level tasks defined that each can have their own command but according to various posts out there, we cannot and this kind of workaround is recommended.  But it isn't working for me.  

You can see that I'm asking to show the output, but when I run the build task via the keyboard shortcut or the <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> menu, the spinner spins, the first command seems to get run (because I can see the output files get created) but the second doesn't run and doesn't generate any output to the output pane which VSCode makes visible.  The third never runs either.  If I move the `echo 42` to the first position then I'll see 42 in the output window _sometimes_ but it is inconsistent.  If `echo 42` is first and `tsc` is second, tsc does not get run.  The deploy.sh does generate output when run in the terminal, but even if it is first, it doesn't get run or generate output 

Also sometimes, the busy spinner in the bottom left corner gets stuck in the spinning mode, but the ""Terminate Running Task"" does nothing to fix it.  I don't know if this is a task that is really still running, or just a UI that falls out of sync.  Restarting VSCode fixes it.

I even tried wrapping the args like `""args"": [""\\""echo 42\\""""]` because in the terminal `bash -c ""echo 42""` and `bash -c "".\\Deploy.sh""` work fine.  This seems to have no effect sometimes but other times I get ""bash: echo 42: command not found"" in the output pane.  I suspect there's some kind of delay in refreshing the tasks.json contents into VSCode's memory or something but I haven't really figured it out - I'm mostly just baffled.

125933856,IntelliSense filtering has become slow again in huge lists,"Copied from the inital issue (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extensionbuilders/issues/80)

> Let's see this scenario:
> - The cursor is placed on whitespace inside a method
> - The user asks for completions by pressing `CTRL + Space`
> - The language service is being asked to provide all suggestions
> - The suggestion box pops up containing all 20k symbols
> - The user types the character `f`
> - **VSCode hangs for ~8 seconds** until the letter is displayed and the suggestion box shows only suggestions containing an `f`. (VSCode doesn't ask for suggestions twice. All the time is spent outside the language service. )
> - typing the next letter is being processed faster but it's still slow. 

@joaomoreno fixed this issue on 2015-11-06 telling that there were too many event listeners. With the December update it has become slow again. VSCode hangs now for **~10 seconds** working on the same suggestion list. 
I really hope it's going to be fast again with the January update. It's not funny to work in huge projects now.

126099245,VSCode freezes if run as a background process on Linux (0.10.6),"I could start it easily from a terminal as a background process in Fedora 23 (using ampersand). However, after an upgrade to 0.10.6 (64bit), it freezes soon after opening. It was not the case in the previous versions.

I suspect it might be related to the git integration somehow. It freezes if a folder is under git source control. It does not freeze otherwise. When I run it with the verbose option, it stops right before prompting for my repository credentials (which it normally does if not frozen).

126129237,Issue installing extensions behind authenticated proxy,"From @FloMaetschke:

I have set http.proxy, https.proxy and http.proxyStrictSSL = false,

I want to install extensions:
CTRL + P: enter: > inst .. wait a moment, select ""Extensions: Install Extensions"".

With the latest decembe release: I get a blue loading bar after a few seconds it says: 
""ERROR Unable to verify the first certificate""

With your first build you posted here: 
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/155#issuecomment-169963541

I just get an endless loading bar and nothing happens.

With your second build you posted here:
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/155#issuecomment-170519605

I just happens nothing, it instantly closes the prompt without any result.

Any idea?

UPDATE:

I have had a look into the developer console.
With both of your builds, vs code tries to load the extensions stuff. But our enterprise proxy returns 
a 

```
  Access Denied (authentication_failed)

  Your credentials could not be authenticated: ""Credentials are missing."". You will not be permitted    access until your credentials can be verified.

  This is typically caused by an incorrect username and/or password.
```

My settings.json looks like this:

```
// Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings.
{
        //-------- HTTP configuration --------

    // The proxy setting to use. If not set will be taken from the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables
    ""http.proxy"": ""http://myusername:mypassword@123.123.123.123:8080"",
    ""https.proxy"": ""http://myusername:mypassword@123.123.123.123:8080"",

    // Whether the proxy server certificate should be verified against the list of supplied CAs.
    ""http.proxyStrictSSL"": false,
}
```

The thing is, i am acutally using the same source of the http.proxy value in my git, npm and bower proxy config. I Also set this up for HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY. Thats where i copy/pasted it from. And well, it just works fine there.

This makes me think gulp watch is working, but in effect, it is not writing to disk the generated js files. IMHO it would be better if the entire thing would die rather than log output that indicates it is running fine (picking up on file changes, compiling them, but then not emitting the js).

When chat view and session list view are side by side, archiving the active session from the list makes the item disappear from the list, but the chat view still shows the archived session content. More natural behavior would be to clear the chat view when the session is archived.

The justification for the original fix is that correctness is much more important than performance here as pasting large amounts of data like this is an edge case, at least in a terminal within an editor.

* Engineering wide it is error-prone because each place that does editing needs to check, for instance the ""Apply In Editor"" action doesn't honour this setting
* I think the UI should be better, instead of showing a diff in the chat view, we should utilise the real editor. Like with normal edits but have Accept (vs Keep) and Discard (vs Undo) (related https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277665)
* It makes using edit tools, outside of chat, bogus because of these complex UI requirements. For instance, inline chat could go the Accept/Discard route or ask you upfront.

### Reproduction Steps:

1. Open Visual studio code insider.
2. Check for the keyboard shortcut which will direct to the copilot chatbox.

### Actual Result:
In the GitHub Copilot chat within the Visual Studio Code application, there should be a keyboard shortcut that allows users to directly navigate onto the 'Describe what to build next' edit field.

### Suggested Implementation:
In the GitHub Copilot Chat within Visual Studio Code, users frequently interact with the 'Describe what to build next' edit field. Adding a dedicated keyboard shortcut to directly navigate to this field would enhance accessibility and improve workflow efficiency, especially for users who rely on keyboard navigation or assistive technologies.

### User Impact:
Keyboard and screen reader users are required to perform multiple keystrokes to navigate onto the edit field.

I have used Web Expressions 4 for a long time. One of the things that helps to generate code quicker is the ability select a line of code in either window (Code or Preview) and  that line of code is highlighted in the other window. This makes it MUCH easier to find error of any type as it is easier to see the error in the preview window, when the line is highlight in the preview window the corresponding line of code is highlightded in the code window.

3711013180,Auto-approve GitHub Copilot non-destructive `sed` usage.,"As I understand it (I'm not a `sed` expert), only the `sed -i` command is destructive. All other usages are read-only.

The LLM often needs to use `sed` to search files. I shouldn't be bothered for file searches. But I do want to know if the LLM is using `sed` to edit a file.

For example the LLM needed to look up the source code of my own GlobalMentor library in order to refactor the code to use one of its utilities. The source code is in another directory tree. I provided instructions on how to find it. So the LLM issued this benign command (part of path redacted):

```bash
sed -n '140,160p' /…/globalmentor-base/core/src/main/java/com/globalmentor/java/Objects.java
```

That's fine. I shouldn't be bothered with that. Unfortunately the auto-approve setting for `sed` is not granular enough: it says ""Always Allow Command: sed"".

**Please add a way to specify ""Always allow `sed` except when used with the `-i` option."".**

The implementation may require normalization of the CLI command line, as laid out in #281779.

3708704145,Feature Request: Support local context import/export functionality for Copilot Chat,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
### Background
The current Copilot Chat extension provides powerful AI assistance and leverages local context (open files, selections, workspace, etc.) to deliver relevant suggestions and chat behavior. However, there is no built-in way for users to manually export or import their local context—for example, to reuse context across environments, share it with team members, or restore their session in a new VS Code instance.

### Feature Proposal
**Add support for exporting and importing local context in Copilot Chat.**

#### Motivation & Use Cases
- **Workspace portability**: Users may want to transfer their current coding context (open files, selections, workspace paths, environment info) between devices or VS Code installations.
- **Collaboration**: Exporting a reproducible context lets users share their coding environment with teammates, making collaboration, reproducing bugs, or onboarding easier.
- **Session recovery**: After crashes, system changes, or resets, users could restore their Copilot Chat context and quickly resume their workflow.
- **Troubleshooting and support**: When reporting issues, the ability to attach exported context (especially when relevant to LLM interactions) would help maintainers reproduce problems more accurately.

#### Proposed Functionality
- **Export Local Context**
    - Save open files, selections, active workspace, git branch, LLM model info, and Copilot Chat settings as a structured JSON file.
    - Optionally include OS, VS Code, extension versions, and relevant session metadata.
    - Simple command: ""Copilot Chat: Export Context"" to save as `copilot-context.json`.

- **Import Local Context**
    - Command: ""Copilot Chat: Import Context"" to load a compatible JSON file.
    - Users can choose actions: restore open files, paste saved selections, set workspace environment.
    - For privacy, limit restoration to editor/session only unless user opts to share sensitive metadata.

#### Expected Behavior
- After exporting, user receives a `.json` file containing session context.
- After importing, context is injected/restored into VS Code/Copilot Chat as far as extension APIs allow.
- User sees clear messages of what was restored and can opt-out of specific context types.

#### Benefits
- Improves productivity, reproducibility, team workflows, and support quality.
- Aligns with current best practices for bug reporting and troubleshooting.

### Example Workflow
1. User works in VS Code with Copilot Chat and custom context (open files A, B, selected text, on Git branch `feature-xyz`).
2. Runs ""Export Context"" command, saves `copilot-context.json`.
3. Shares file with team member or attaches in issue report.
4. Another user runs ""Import Context"", restoring session as close as API allows (open files, selections, etc.).

### Additional Notes
- Respect privacy: context export must prompt user about including sensitive data.
- Security: context import should validate file format, ideally offer preview before restoration.
- Interoperability: exported format should be clearly documented.

### Environment Details
- **VS Code version**: [Please insert]
- **Copilot Chat extension version**: [Please insert]
- **Operating system**: [Please insert]
- **LLM model**: [Please insert if applicable]

### Reproducible Steps
N/A – this is a feature request rather than a bug report.

### What I expect
Ability to easily export/import session/local context for Copilot Chat to aid collaboration, portability and support.

### What currently happens
No built-in import/export function for session or local context.

Copilot in the secondary sidebar has a button to see history. When you open the chat in a new window (compact), there is no option to see chat history. You can get it to show by turning off Compact Mode, or using the Command Palette, but a button would make access easier.

Recently, we observed the much lower survival rate issue of GPT models compared to sonnet model and even grok-fast models. To help identify the root cause, we want to log more information:
 
1) Besides 30s/2min/5min/10min, we want to log the survival rate for 0s (right after AIEdit, I want to double confirm the survival rate is 1.0)  and 5s as well. The implementation of this should be easy, only need to add two lines of code.

2) Besides logging the currentFileContent, we also want to log the originalText, AIEditText and UserEdit as well. I used agent and provide a reference implementation (I am not a typescript expert, just want to provide some reference code change to help understand what we want to log). Please forgive me if I made any stupid code implementation error here.

I am wondering for quite some time, as a user that uses the VSCode UI for git operations why there is no ""push tags"" feature. I know there is a vscode command for pushing tags, but its not available in the UI. This is bad, because you may have other git repos inside your opened folder where you also want to push tags.

Going further, i would even propose that the sync command should also push any tags that are not pushed, furthermore as well that vscode shows you that you have tags not pushed.

2. Create a new Terminal (menu: Terminal » New terminal)

In the latest release, we added Measures.isauto to the /response events (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/269537). It would be great to also have it on the /panel.request event Measure bag. The reason is that we see some situations where certain errors are propagating only to /panel.request and we cannot distinguish between auto and non-auto when this happens. There is another issue to take care of those error situations (to propagate the /response events) but it would be great to have this attribute in both places. If it's easy, it would make sense to do the same for Measures.isbyok but that isn't as important.

### Environment Details:
Application Name: VS Code
Edition Windows 11 Enterprise
Version 25H2
OS build 26200.6899
Version: 1.107.20251118007-insider (user setup)


### Repro Steps:
Prerequisites: Use Magnifier at 400% with DPI scaling at 100% and resolution at 1280 x 1024px.

1. Open VS Code.
2. Tab till Settings and press enter.
3. Tab till keyboard shortcut.
4. Verify that When using the magnifier in reflow mode, the user has to scroll back and forth to view the content

### Actual Result:
When using the magnifier in reflow mode, the user has to scroll back and forth to view the content.

### Expected Result:
Content should reflow within a 320px viewport without requiring horizontal scrolling. This includes wrapping long lines of text and ensuring UI elements don’t overlap or truncate.

### User Impact:
Users who use screen magnifiers may miss important information if content is cut off or hidden, and may become frustrated having to move back and forth to view everything.

When Plan Mode finishes creating a plan, people see a ""Start Implementation"" button.

Currently: Clicking it does two things:

1. Adds ""Start Implementation"" text to the prompt area
2. Takes them back down to the prompt where they can either hit send or add more instructions

Alternatively, they can click the separate ""Delegate"" button, which opens a selection menu.

We would like to reduce that friction and get them to delegate plan more efficiently 

There are various places in the journey that this could happen

1. At the point of the original prompt ""Make a plan for a to do"" -> Send and Implement the entire plan. This sends the prompt, and add ""Start Implementation"" to a the queue
2. At the response:  Once you have a response you can you can delegate
3. While you are reviewing: You can select (maybe highlight a section) and send to background
4. While it's building:  While everything is being implemented, you can open up the ""to do"" list and send out a specific step to be sent to the background.

Goals for this are:

- Reduce friction (Time to task)
- Increase Delegation usage (More delegations)
- Increase discoverability (People use this feature faster)",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278484,1

Help users pick a model that makes sense for them.

The chat windows in VSCode has a dropdown menu to select a model.  Hovering over a menu entry shows a tooltip with the model's description.  
However, the descriptions is at most a generic restatement of the cost and name of the model and could be more helpful such as providing a brief description of the tasks the model is suitable for. 

The tasks information can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison

Example of current tooltip:
Menu entry: ""GPT-5 1x"" -> ""GPT-5 (gpt-5) is counted at a 1x rate""

The menu entry is simply restated.

Menu entry: ""GPT-5 1x"" -> ""GPT-5 (gpt-5): Deep Reasoning and Debugging""

The ""View as Tree""/""View as List"" button was removed 1.106.0 was removed to ""clean up the view"". See #277082.

I personally used this button very often and this is an annoying regression.
But it might be an opportunity for a new feature.

My proposal is to give the choice to the user for what actions they want quick access to, and for what they don't. 

Currently the choice is only available for ""Commit"" and 'Refresh"". It could be available for any action available from the menu. I would personally add (or restore) quick access buttons for view mode, fetch and stash. 

I agree de-cluttering the UI is usually beneficial, but I have issues with how it was done: 
- The menu went from 4 buttons to 3 buttons. Not cluttered in my opinion, there's plenty of space left
- One can already hide buttons by right clicking on them. I personally don't use the ""commit"" button. But one can't add buttons.

However, if contributing to a new project, you don't want to accidentally mix your functional changes with many lines of formatting change if the project's standards are different to your default configuration.

There should be a setting for ""maintain format"".

- On opening a file, the editor would check whether it is formatted already.
- If it was, formatting is enabled, so that the file is formatted as usual on save and the correct formatting is maintained.
- If the formatted buffer is not identical to the existing file, formatting is disabled.

An alternative implementation would be to rely on VCS: when attempting to format the file, first try to format the last committed version, and abort if that was not formatted.

This may be functionally similar to the existing ""format changes"" setting, but has the following advantages:

- does not rely on the formatter's ability to format ranges
- does not produce a mismatch between your changes formatted based on your config, and the rest of the file formatted

Example:

console.error(""error""); // red
```

---

## Additional Note

I have read the previous issues on this topic (e.g. #173545 and related discussions), and I would like to respectfully express that I **do not fully agree with the reasoning behind not implementing this enhancement**.

The commonly stated reasons — such as theme token complexity, Debug Console not being a full log viewer, or warnings being treated as “errors” in DAP — do not seem sufficiently compelling for the following reasons:

1. **Most major IDEs and tools already distinguish warn/error colors**  
   This has been a long-established UX standard in developer tooling.  
   VS Code being an exception does not align with typical debugging expectations.

2. **Theme tokens can be extended in a backward-compatible manner**  
   New tokens (e.g. `debugConsole.warningForeground`) can fall back to the current behavior if not defined.  
   This is a pattern VS Code has successfully used many times before.

3. **DAP and debugger output classifications do not technically prevent color separation**  
   `console.warn` originates from JavaScript runtime, not from debugger protocol decisions.  
   VS Code already distinguishes `console.log` and `console.error`, so extending this is feasible.

4. **The Debug Console is widely used for real-world debugging**  
   While VS Code team often states that ""Debug Console is not intended to be a full log viewer"",  
   in practice, developers *do* rely on it because it integrates tightly with breakpoints, scopes, and variable views.  
   Therefore, improving its readability is meaningful and high-impact.

5. **This is a small visual improvement with disproportionately large usability benefits**  
   It requires minimal UI work but significantly improves debugging clarity.

For these reasons, I believe this request deserves reconsideration.  
Thank you for taking the time to re-evaluate this — many developers would benefit from this improvement.

Currently, the .github/agents directory only recognizes `*.agent.md` files placed directly under it. Agent files stored in subdirectories such as .github/agents/foo/agent.agent.md are ignored, which prevents structured packaging of agents together with their associated templates, scripts, and reference materials.

I would like to request support for placing agent definition files inside subdirectories under .github/agents.

Example:

- .github/agents/agent1.agent.md (recognized)

- .github/agents/create-pptx/agent2.agent.md **(not recognized)**

## Proposal

1. Enable recursive discovery of *.agent.md files under .github/agents/**/* (optionally restricted to a single subdirectory level).
2. Allow configurable discovery depth or ignore patterns through a file such as .github/agents/settings.json.

## Motivation

In [Claude Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#level-3%3A-resources-and-code-loaded-as-needed), you can include Python scripts and other assets in a dedicated scripts directory. The benefits of this approach include:

- Distributing the directory as a whole makes it easy for agents to execute the scripts.
- Placing template files related to the agent within the skill simplifies maintenance.
- It can include another agent file inside itself that uses the same template.
- Users can distribute a library that contains multiple agents as a ZIP file or similar package. To use it, they only need to place it in the agents directory, which allows them to use multiple agents easily.

Example: This agent directory provides custom agents related to PDFs.

```txt
pdf-skill/
├── create_pdf.agent.md

├── FORMS.md (form-filling guide)

**Replace the “Chat” header in active sessions with the session title, matching how titles appear in chat history.** 

Showing the session title directly in the header helps users stay oriented across multiple types of chat sessions and reduces cognitive load by making each session identifiable at a glance. This mirrors how users already identify sessions in the chat sessions view, carrying that context into the active sessions.

3610261000,"Chat extension should dynamically activate extensions based on chat context, not just editor context","## Description

Currently, the VS Code chat extension only activates extensions based on editor context (e.g., when a file is opened). This creates a gap when using chat with MCP tools from extensions like Pylance, where:

1. The extension may not be activated if no relevant files are open
2. Even when forced to activate programmatically, there's no reliable signal that all features (especially MCP tools) are ready
3. The `extension.isActive` flag returns `true` after light activation, but before full activation completes (e.g., before the language server and MCP server are fully started)

## Expected Behavior

- Chat extension should dynamically activate extensions based on the chat context when MCP tools from those extensions are needed
- There should be a reliable signal/API to determine when an extension's Copilot features (like MCP tools) are fully ready, separate from the basic activation promise

## Current Workaround

Currently in evaluation scenarios, we're forced to:
1. Explicitly activate extensions programmatically before chat sessions
2. Add arbitrary wait times (e.g., sleep) after activation to allow side effects to settle
3. This diverges from the end-user experience and creates potential flakiness

## Suggested Solution

1. Enable chat to trigger extension activation based on available MCP tools/chat participants needed for the conversation
2. Provide an API or event that extensions can use to signal when their Copilot features are fully ready (beyond the basic activation promise)

3601754699,Allow the Panel (as a whole) to behave like an editor region for better use of screen space,"### Problem

On ultra-wide or large monitors, the VS Code panel (which hosts tabs like Terminal, Output, Problems, and Debug Console) currently spans the entire width of the window when placed at the bottom.
This layout wastes a lot of horizontal space, since most panel content (especially the terminal or Problems view) only uses a small fraction of that width.

While moving the panel to the right helps a little, the current design only allows the panel to dock at fixed locations (bottom or side) and always takes the full width or height of the window. This limits layout flexibility and prevents making better use of large horizontal screen space.

### Proposed Feature

Allow the entire panel area to be handled like an editor region — not detachable tabs, but the panel as one cohesive unit that can be positioned and resized freely alongside other editor groups.

Specifically:

- Make the panel dockable anywhere in the editor layout grid (top, bottom, left, right, or next to another editor group).
- Let users resize it both horizontally and vertically, just like an editor group.
- Keep the panel’s tab system (Terminal, Output, Problems, Debug Console, etc.) exactly as it is — just more flexible in placement and sizing.
- Optionally, allow this behavior to be enabled with a setting such as: `""workbench.panel.flexibleLayout"": true`

### Benefits

- Greatly improves usability on ultra-wide screens where bottom-docked panels waste large amounts of space.
- Maintains the coherent panel concept (tabs stay grouped together), avoiding the complexity of separate detachable panel items.
- Makes the workspace layout more consistent with editor groups — you could have, for example, a narrower panel to the right or a smaller one below a secondary editor.
- Provides a better, more efficient use of screen real estate without altering existing panel behavior.

### Current Workarounds

- You can move the panel to the right or left, but it still behaves as a full-height, single container that occupies an entire side.
- You can move the terminal into the editor area individually, but that breaks the consistency of the unified panel tab system.

### Summary

This proposal aims to make the panel itself behave as a flexible layout region — just like an editor group — while keeping its internal tab system intact.
It would dramatically improve workspace efficiency, particularly on ultra-wide monitors, and align with VS Code’s evolving flexible layout philosophy.

Please note that this proposal should not be considered a duplicate of issue [#193267](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/193267) (“Aux window: allow detaching views and panels”), as it does not request detachable panel tabs. Instead, it focuses on allowing the entire panel area to behave like an editor region, while preserving its integrated tab system.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276176,1

Hello team,

I would like to suggest exploring built-in support for speech-driven coding and refactoring in VS Code and Copilot.

Voice-based programming can strengthen accessibility, reduce strain-related barriers, and enable hands-free rapid prototyping and structural editing.

I have been experimenting with a prototype called Typist, which demonstrates real-time speech-to-code for Java and Python via browser speech APIs. It also explores multilingual spoken input, reflecting how voice-enabled programming can scale for global developer accessibility.

Example utterance:
`if open bracket x greater than zero close bracket newline return x`

Repository: [here](https://github.com/tundeadetunji/app_stt)

This note simply shares a proof-of-concept and interaction model, not a request to adopt the code.

I would be glad to compare notes if useful.

I work in an organization with a large number of Claude Code users who maintain a set of [Claude Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). We have a smaller number of GitHub Copilot in VSCode users, but we wish to standardize on using both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot this year, leaving it up to personal preference which one the developers will be using.

My short term solution has been to update .github/copilot-instructions.md with explicit instructions on Claude skills file structure (`.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`) such that when I say ""load claude skill XYZ"" it will find the SKILL.md file and load the i`nstructions. This is a low-tech solution that temporarily solves the problem.

Now the bigger problem is that Claude Skills go beyond just a fancy SKILL.md file, they have related files which also need to be loaded on demand. More importantly, Claude Code is checking the front-matter of the SKILL.md file to determine when it should be loaded, such that you don't need to explicitly ask for it to be loaded.

What I'd like is a way for GitHub Copilot in VSCode to be able to reuse existing Claude Skills in a way that closely matches the behavior in Claude Code.

3591823464,"Notebook layout and navigation: PyCharm vs VSCode, visual distinction, and scrolling flexibility","## Feature Request: Improve Notebook Usability Compared to PyCharm

### Problem Areas:
- **Screen space & block distinction**: VSCode’s notebook UI is too large and flat. Most of the screen gets occupied by a single notebook, so I often only see the cell at the very bottom, with no easy way to visually separate blocks/cells. Unlike PyCharm, which uses a sidebar rectangle or highlight to indicate the current cell/block, VSCode’s style makes it hard to understand where one block begins and another ends.
- **Scrolling: Reveal Next Cell On Execute** is inflexible: After Shift+Enter, the viewport jumps but I still mostly see only the next cell’s first line, or the bottom-most part of the notebook, making navigation awkward. I would like more granular control over how much context appears—sometimes I want to see more than just a line of the next block, or see the tail of the previous cell’s output.
- **Visual style**: The notebook’s appearance is too flat, making it hard to track which cell is focused or currently running. More contrast or a side indicator (like PyCharm’s sidebar rectangle) would make blocks easier to track visually.

### Suggestions:
- Make the reveal/scrolling behavior after cell execution configurable. For example:
  - Allow setting how many lines or how much percentage of context to reveal.
  - Optionally keep both the tail of the previous cell output and part of the next cell visible after execution.
- Add clearer visual boundaries or highlights for active blocks/cells. A sidebar, color accent, or stronger focus indicator (like in PyCharm) would make it easier to see where the active cell is.
- Consider layout and density options to allow users to control cell size and padding.

### Example configuration snippets to include in settings (suggested)
- Settings-based example (settings.json):
```json
{
  // Controls reveal behavior after executing a cell (Shift+Enter)
  ""notebook.revealOnExecute"": ""smart"", // ""firstLine"" | ""end"" | ""center"" | ""smart"" | ""customLines""

  // When using ""customLines"", this controls how many lines of the previous output remain visible
  ""notebook.revealOnExecuteLines"": 10,

  // An alternative offset-based approach: pixel or percentage of viewport
  ""notebook.revealOnExecuteOffset"": ""80px"" // or ""15%""
}
```

- Behavior examples:
  - ""end"": after execute+move, ensure the bottom of the previous cell's output is visible so users can verify results quickly.
  - ""customLines"" + 10: keep the last 10 lines of previous output visible after navigation.
  - ""smart"": heuristics — if previous output is short, show all; if very long, show last N lines (e.g. 8–12) or use offset to show the output tail while preserving some of the next cell's top.

### Small UI mock / visual suggestion (CSS-like pseudocode)
```css
/* stronger left focus indicator, similar to PyCharm's left rectangle */
.notebook-cell.focused {
  box-shadow: inset 4px 0 0 var(--vscode-focusBorder);
  background-color: rgba(var(--vscode-editor-background-rgb), 0.02);
}
.notebook-cell:not(.focused) {
  border-left: 4px solid transparent;
}
```

### Reference: PyCharm Notebook UI
PyCharm’s approach to notebook visuals and navigation is more intuitive, especially regarding active cell indication and contextual scrolling.

### Related issues/discussions
- Issue [#16937](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/16937) identifies the scrolling/visibility inconvenience — I am specifically requesting more flexibility and visual distinction. PyCharm’s visual cues and scrolling options provide a better experience.

There is couple of problems in this dialog. First of all, it does not have options ""Yes to all"" and ""No to all"". Another problem is, that a bit counter-intuitively Cancel does not actually cancel anything, but it's actually ""No"". So when the dialog asks, ""Do you want to replace it?"", there should actually be three answers: 1) Yes, 2) No, 3) Cancel, where cancel should mean that ""No, and close this dialog"". Currently, there is no ""Cancel"" at all, but only Yes and No. So hitting esc of clicking ""Cancel"" does not actually escape you from the dialog, but instead answers ""No"" to the current file and continues on next one. I was lucky that I had to ""Cancel"" the operation only 100 times as I didn't have more files to transfer.

To my view, how this dialog should work, is that it is having answers ""Yes"", ""No"", ""Yes to all"", ""No to all"", which actually answers to the question that is asked in the dialog. Then there should be ""Cancel"" what means ""No, and top whatever you are doing and close this dialog"". The low hanging fruit would be to at least rename the ""Cancel"" button to ""No"", because that it what it is actually doing.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/275470,1

3580968955,"Add Hover-Activated ""Copy Region"" Button for Named Code Regions (e.g., #region)","
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

## Description:

Many developers use named code regions (e.g., `#region`/`#endregion` in C#, C++, TypeScript, or similar directives in other languages) to organize large codebases. These regions help collapse/expand sections, improving readability. However, copying the entire content of a region currently requires manual selection (which can be error-prone for large regions) or using workarounds like extensions or custom shortcuts.

I’d like to propose a built-in feature: **a clickable ""Copy Region"" button** that appears when hovering over a named region’s header (e.g., the line with `#region MyRegion`). This button would streamline the process of copying the entire content of the region (including nested code, excluding the `#region`/`#endregion` directives themselves, or optionally including them) with a single click.


## Proposed Behavior:
- When the user hovers their mouse over a `#region` (or equivalent) header line, a small ""Copy"" button (icon or text) appears adjacent to the region’s collapse/expand toggle (▶/▼).
- Clicking the button copies the entire content of the region (from the line after `#region` to the line before `#endregion`) to the clipboard.
- Optional: A brief tooltip (""Copied!"") confirms success.
- The button should only appear for recognized, valid regions (to avoid cluttering non-region lines).


## Use Cases:
- Quickly copying modular sections of code (e.g., utility functions, configuration blocks) for reuse in other files or projects.
- Reducing errors from manual selection (e.g., accidentally missing lines or including extra content).
- Improving workflow efficiency for developers who frequently work with organized, region-based code.


## Alternatives Considered:
- Manual selection: Error-prone for large regions; requires precise cursor movement.
- Extensions (e.g., Region Folder, Region Plus): These add region management features but lack a native, hover-activated copy button. They also rely on third-party maintenance and may conflict with VS Code updates.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Require memorization and don’t provide visual confirmation.


## Why This Should Be Built-In:
Named regions are a core organizational feature in many languages supported by VS Code. A built-in copy button would align with VS Code’s focus on developer productivity, providing a seamless, consistent experience across extensions and updates.


## Additional Details:
- The button’s appearance should follow VS Code’s design system (e.g., subtle, unobtrusive until hovered).
- For nested regions, the button should target the specific region being hovered (not parent/child regions).
- Configurability (e.g., including/excluding `#region` directives in the copied content) could be added via settings.

Thank you for considering this feature—it would significantly streamline working with organized code regions!

Haven't thought it through fully, but here's another idea for associating the tool call with the command which may end up being simpler:

- Only support linking commands for rich command detection
- In prepare, create the command ID manually via `tool-${generateUuid()}` and set on `toolSpecificData`, this would make serialize of the part just work at long as we restore the custom command ID
- In invoke, pass that command ID into `runCommand`
- Tell the pty host and renderer shell integration addon that the next command with the matching command line is the ID we created

In some environments the word 'Hey Code' is being triggered erratically due to other languages being spoken in the office. It would be nice to be able to select from a list of optional names that could reduce cross-talk.

Hey Code works but single but rather esoteric words\\name might be better for flow

""Albatross, please run the performance test""
""Exedor, please run the integration test""
""Lannados, make a commit and trigger the reports please.""

this would give devs that might be working within earshot of one another to at least have different 'names' for their activation word. We've all had to deal with how often 'Alexa' gets accidentally triggered.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274127,1

It would be great if we can provide a feature to have an ongoing one-to-one conversation to discuss different aspects of the code similar to the voice mode in GPT, The current implementation illustrated in the image above just allows the user to covert voice to text instead of being an actual voice conversation.

#### Issue

In a large script I want to `Find and Replace` a specific variable name with a new variable name which better fits the purpose of that specific variable. After that, I make additional changes in my script and after testing it later, I find out that the new variable name was actually already in use 🥴. This places me in an situation where I have to either undo *all* my changes (up from the replacement) or find all new variable names and determine whether it was actually replaced or not.
To avoid this from happening again, I often put the new variable name in the `Find` textbox first (to check whether it already used) before I put it into the `Replace` Textbox.

#### Propose

A result (match whole word?) count behind the `Replace` textbox (similar to the result count behind the `Find` textbox) might avoid such a situation where a program, script or document gets cluttered with the same words that already existed before the replacement.

#### Alternative

As an alternative, a ""swap"" button might also be helpful for this situation:

Hi all,
I was pleasantly surprised to find configuration options for the NPM Package Manager and Script Runner (as seen below).

<img width=""520"" height=""296"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91669ecc-12c7-42ee-ab03-ae96be94174a"" />

I would kindly request Deno to be added to that list. Currently, launching npm scripts attempts to use Node, despite the appropriate Deno lock files being available. Node, however, is not installed and thus I cannot run the script.
Adding Deno support would fully flesh out the selection and enable a fair playing field for all runtimes and package managers.

3560317829,Issue with glob patterns and absolute Windows paths as directory names,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I'm not sure how special this issue is and would like to find other ways to solve it, but for some reason our software creates 1 directory in our workspace directory (when run from there, of course) which is named after an absolute Windows path, e.g. `""D:\\\\SPAPPLI\\\\xyz\\\\log\\\\tps""`, so under Linux the absolute path to a file in that directory might look like this: `""/home/jdoe/workspace/D:\\\\SPAPPLI\\\\xyz\\\\log\\\\tps/debug.log""`

The problem is that for some reason the glob pattern matcher does not except any one of the following patterns, e.g. when used in the setting `""files.exclude""`:

```
**/D*
**/D:*
**/D:\\\\SPAPPLI*
**/D:\\\\SPAPPLI\\\\*
```

It only works if I enter the complete directory name; so this would work:

```
**/D:\\\\SPAPPLI\\\\xyz\\\\log\\\\tps
```

So there seems to be an issue with the asterisk `*` in a glob pattern when there is also a colon `:` and/or an escaped backslash `\\`, either in the file/directory name or the glob pattern itself.

Although I would like to find a solution to why our software is creating the directory ""verbatim"" and perhaps try to convert it into a Linux directory structure, it would be great if I could have a more general glob pattern in VS Code instead of having to add multiple similar directories manually.

**Can Alt-LeftDrag be bound to the same functionality as Alt-Shift-LeftDrag (column select)?**

That's the way most other editors do it:

Atom (with Sublime Style Column Selection)
Eclipse
Notepad++
Programmer's Notepad
Sublime
Visual Studio 2015

**It seems like issue #5402 got sidetracked by the virtual space issue. I don't care about that.**

I'm happy with the existing column select. I just want it bound to Alt-LeftDrag for muscle memory reasons.

3552847879,Add a “Maximize Editor” button similar to the Terminal panel,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>


Currently, the integrated terminal in VS Code has a convenient ""maximize/restore"" button, allowing users to quickly enlarge or restore the panel.
I hope a similar button can be added to the editor area (code document tab area).

When working with multiple split editors or panels, it would be very helpful to have a one-click way to maximize the current code file view, instead of using keyboard shortcuts or manually resizing panels.

Example:
Just like the maximize icon in the integrated terminal panel, but located on the top-right corner of the code editor area (as shown in the screenshot).

This would make it much easier to focus on one file temporarily, especially when multiple editors or panels are open.

- As you can see it is possible to copy the setting name and various other options but it would be very useful to be able to copy the description from the same place.
- The reason this is a good thing is for people who are doing documentation can make  sure they get things right without having to manually type the whole thing out on a text editor.

### Additional

Can you also add the ability to copy the setting's options with their descriptions?

### Research

- You can use a cursor to select the description but it can be fiddly and does not always work. 
- As per https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/reference/default-settings I can open `defaultSettings.json`, search for `workbench.editor.revealIfOpen` and copy the comments. ",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/273132,1

Given that VSCode already provides the option to put the ""close tab"" button on the left where it belongs on macOS, it would be nice if it were also possible to center text. In my opinion putting the close button (""action button"") on the left makes the tabs look even worse than they do with the button on the non-standard side:

Coming from an offline email with @isidorn 
Steps to Reproduce:

1. In our package.json, we have a taskDefinition as follows:
```
""taskDefinitions"": [
            {
                ""type"": ""func"",
                ""required"": [
                    ""command""
                ],
                ""properties"": {
                    ""command"": {
                        ""type"": ""string""
                    },
                    ""args"": {
                        ""type"": ""array"",
                        ""items"": {
                            ""type"": ""string""
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
```
2. In the tasks.json, there is the following task:
```
{
			""type"": ""func"",
			""dependsOn"": ""build (functions)"",
			""options"": {
				""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/net9.0""
			},
			""command"": ""host start"",
			""args"": [
				""--dotnet-isolated-debug"",
				""--enable-json-output""
			],
			""isBackground"": true,
			""problemMatcher"": ""$func-dotnet-watch""
		}
```
3. In our extension code, we dynamically create the task in the following constructor:
```
new Task(definition, folder, command, func, new ShellExecution(commandLine, options), problemMatcher);
```
4. Set a `vscode.window.onDidStartTerminalShellExecution` or a `vscode.window.onDidChangeTerminalShellIntegration` event handler.
5. Start our launch with F5 which kicks off our task.
6. When the other type `process` tasks run, these trigger an event on the event handlers. However, the `func` task does not fire an event despite being run in the same terminal as the `process` tasks.

3545380928,SCM - new menu proposal for the Repositories view,"Extension authors have the abilityt to contribute actions to the Changes view's title using the `scm/title` menu contribution point. When a repository row is being rendered in the Changes view (due to `scm.alwaysShowRepositories` or due to multiple repositories being shown), these actions are ""moved"" from the view's title to the repository row.

Since we use the ""repository renderer"" in the Changes and Repositories views, the actions contributed to the `scm/title` menu contribution point also appear in the Repositories view so users can end up with something that looks like this:

<img width=""383"" height=""151"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df96ba10-6444-441b-bf70-f40058682486"" />

Some of these actions make sense in the Changes view but do not make any sense in the Repositories view (ex: Commit, Refresh). Couple of months ago we also added the capability to hide individual menu items in the two views independently and in order to do that we have to clone menu items from the `scm/title` menu contribution point to another other that resulted in multiple bugs.

As part of our effort to improve the Repositories view we are introducing a new menu extension point, `scm/repository` that extension authors can leverage to contribute actions to each repository in the repositories view. Action in the `inline` group will be rendered inline while all other actions will be rendered in the `...` menu.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/272941,1

Being able to ctrl-click the link to open it is still very useful.

3544235360,Feature Request: Support formatting and viewing very large JSON files (>100 MB),"**Describe the feature request**

Currently, when trying to format or view very large JSON files (e.g., 140 MB) in VS Code using the ""Format Document"" shortcut (Shift + Alt + F), VS Code shows the message:

""This file cannot be formatted because it is too large.""

Even though the JSON file is already formatted, VS Code displays it as one long line for large files, making it very difficult to read or work with.

**Proposed Feature**

- Allow formatting of very large JSON files, possibly via a streaming/partial approach.
- Improve rendering performance for large files so that formatted JSON is displayed correctly.
- Consider providing a warning or partial formatting for extremely large files instead of disabling formatting completely.

**Use Case / Motivation**

- Developers often need to analyze logs, exported data, or API responses that are hundreds of MBs in size.
- Currently, large JSON files cannot be formatted or viewed properly in VS Code, forcing users to rely on external tools or editors.

**Example**

- JSON file size: 140 MB
- Shortcut used: Shift + Alt + F
- Expected behavior: File should be formatted or at least partially formatted for readability.
- Current behavior: VS Code shows ""This file cannot be formatted because it is too large"" and displays the file as one long line.

**Additional context**

- Tested in VS Code version: [provide your version, e.g., 1.88.0]
- Operating System: Windows 11

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
To decrease the risk of malicious extensions (like the recent GlassWorm attack), it would be great to have a setting that enforces a minimum extension age.
Package managers like pnpm introduced this same functionality recently: https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9921

With this setting:
* extensions need to be at least x days old before they appear in the extensions.
* automatic updates of extensions happen only x days after they are released.

This way, there is a longer time in which malicious extensions can be detected before the become widespread.

This setting should probably be set to a couple of days by default.

3536351970,Make ExtHostDecorations._maxEventSize configurable via a user setting instead of hardcoded at 250,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

### Background

The Explorer uses the Decorations service to show file badges (e.g. “M”, “U”) from extensions like Git. Currently, the extension host **hard-caps decoration change events at 250 URIs**:

* [`[ExtHostDecorations._maxEventSize = 250](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDecorations.ts)`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/workbench/api/common/extHostDecorations.ts)
* When an extension fires an `onDidChangeFileDecorations` event with >250 items, the event is trimmed before reaching the workbench.
* This leads to situations where the Source Control view correctly shows e.g. 264 modified files, but the Explorer only decorates 250 of them, with the rest silently dropped.

This is discussed in [[#108292](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108292)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108292), where decoration events above 250 items are capped for performance reasons.

---

### Feature request

Instead of a fixed hardcoded limit, expose a **user/workspace setting** (and/or per-extension limit) that allows configuring the maximum decoration event size.

For example:

```json
""workbench.decorations.maxEventSize"": 250 // default
```

* Users working in very large repos could raise this (e.g. 1000, 10000) or set to 0 to disable the cap.
* The default would remain 250 to protect performance for typical projects.

---

### Motivation

* Developers working with large repos often have >250 modified/untracked files.
* Explorer then silently stops showing “M/U” decorations after 250 entries, leading to confusion.
* The Source Control view still shows all changes, but many users rely on Explorer decorations for navigation.
* Making this configurable balances performance safety with flexibility for power users.

---

_I keep on installing lot of Vs code extensions to try them but over a period of time my disk storage is getting occupied because of old extensions which I delete and they left the remains behind - I want a utility in the VS code which searches such garbage and clean it automatially to keep it cluter free._

**See the number of manual steps I need to do to clean the garbage which is left behind by extensions**:

Uninstall the extension from VS Code:
Open the Extensions view's Installed list, locate the extension, click Uninstall (and choose to remove for this workspace if prompted).
Show in Command Palette
Quit VS Code completely (Exit from the application) so files are not locked.

Delete the extension files on disk:

Open the extensions folder and manually delete any folders that match the extension's publisher.name. On Windows check:
%USERPROFILE%.vscode\\extensions
%USERPROFILE%.vscode-insiders\\extensions (if you use Insiders)
C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft VS Code\\resources\\app\\extensions (only for built-in extensions — do not delete builtin unless you know what you're doing)
Show in Command Palette
Remove extension data, caches and settings:
Delete extension global storage and cached VSIXs:
%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\globalStorage<publisher.extension-id>
%APPDATA%\\Code\\CachedExtensionVSIXs (remove matching files)
%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\workspaceStorage (search inside for the extension id and remove matches)
Open and edit your user settings to remove any extension-specific settings:
Show in Command Palette
Run the Cleanup Extensions Folder maintenance action to remove leftover temp folders:
Show in Command Palette
Restart the extension host (or reload the window) to ensure VS Code picks up the removals:
Show in Command Palette
Optional verification: start VS Code with extensions disabled to confirm nothing from the removed extension loads:
Show in Command Palette
Notes:

Search disk folders above for the extension id/publisher name to find all remnants before deleting.
Back up any files before deleting them.
Reboot the machine if some files remain locked after quitting VS Code.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/272442,1

3534573114,[html] support color decorations for SVG attributes of type color,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I would like colors defined in SVG attributes (for example, `lighting-color=""#cccccc""`) to display a color picker, similar to how it works in CSS.

Currently, when VS Code starts up, the color picker briefly appears, but once initialization completes, it disappears. I tested this with all extensions disabled to rule out extension interference.

I found that if I disable either of the built-in extensions HTML Language Features(`vscode.html-language-features`) or HTML Language Basics(`vscode.html`), the color picker remains visible. This suggests the issue may be related to how the HTML language features handle SVG attributes.

- Is this the expected behavior, or is it a bug?
- I understand that VS Code does not provide built-in support for SVG. If this is expected behavior, is it possible to enable the color picker for these attributes by modifying the HTML custom data configuration?

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open an SVG file with attributes containing color values (e.g., lighting-color=""#cccccc"").
2. Restart VS Code.
3. Observe that the color picker briefly appears during startup, then disappears after initialization.

I can't seem to disable this sparkle icon from appearing in the terminal. I asked in GitHub Copilot itself, and the suggestions it gave were for settings that either didn't exist or were irrelevant. Here are a few of its suggestions:

* `terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled`

- The registered MCP server should support the [v0.1 spec](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/docs#/schemas/ServerListResponse) of MCP registry spec 
- The configured end point should be of the form `https://api.mcp.github.com/`. VS Code will add necessary routes like `v0.1/servers/` to access data from the server.
- If access is restricted to registry (in the policy) then
  - Allow starting the installed server only if it is in the registry
  - If the server is a remote server then allow only if the remote server url is same as in the registry

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
I would like a feature to override the minimum editor group width. I often have several groups open, and I can only shrink the unfocused ones to a certain width that I cannot override. Eventually I run out of screen space. If I could override that minimum width, I could have a lot more editor groups open before I run out of space.
Often times I click from one group to another, and VSCode automatically expands the focused group to fill the available space, collapsing all others. So in this scenario, I don't need the unfocused groups to be that big - I just need them big enough for me to click into so they can expand when I'm ready to look at them. Even just 10px or so is enough.
So maybe the setting for that minimum width can be exposed to the user, leaving the default at whatever it is currently, but allowing the user to set their own if they want. It would probably still need some kind of a locked minimum that the user could not go below, at least to prevent negative numbers.

**Problem**: The branch checkout button in the SCM view takes up significant space, especially when working with multiple repositories.

**Proposed solution**: Add settings to control the size/appearance of the SCM branch button:
- `scm.compactBranchButton`: Show only the branch icon without text
- `scm.branchButtonSize`: Control font size and padding

**Use case**: Users with many repositories open want a more compact SCM view while still having quick access to branch switching.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/271679,1

Currently, when amending without a message, a new text document appears with a commit message pre-populated, that you have to close to commit.

Proposed behaviour is to reuse previous message if it's empty, like it's done in almost all editors.

Also, to add a possibility to amend the message only.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Ask for changes in agent mode, keep them
2. Close the editor
3. Open the editor again (new session) and commit, without making any other changes. 
4. Observe that the monacoworkbench/edittelemetry.editsources.details events don't fire

Currently, when hovering over open editor tabs in VS Code, there's no visual preview of the file content, unlike browser tabs that show page thumbnails. Implementing a feature to display a small thumbnail or snapshot of the editor's content on hover would improve navigation efficiency, especially in workspaces with many open files.

3510087659,"Increase status bar height, icon size, text size","There is an opportunity to make the statusbar content more legible & mitigate any future minimum target size issue.

Current font size is `14px`, which causes sub-optimal icon rendering as designs are made on a 16px grid - updating to `16px` would ensure crisper rendering, especially on lower-resolution displays. This would also better align icon sizes across the product UI.

To reduce size differences between icons & text, I propose to increase the font size from `12px` to `13px`. This does come at a horizontal space cost. We could run an experiment to understand impact for customers.

Increasing the statusbar height from `22px` to `24px` would make it pass minimum target size requirements, while only increasing `2px` in height. This slight increase would also provide vertical padding for the larger icons.

For the agent mode to make use of this, we should let it know what commands are available, the same way we inform about the available instructions.

Core functionality:

- when `executePrompt` is available, add the list of available slashcommands the same way we add the list of instructions. Give command name, description and URI
- try this out and see how helpful this is: create a prompt that is asked to plan, implement and test

Fit and finish:
- add code completion for slash commands in the prompt file editors. See how this is done for variables (e.g. `#file:../a/b`)>

👋 Hello vscode team,

one of our customers asked if the `telemetry.telemetryLevel` could be split into two, to allow for GitHub Copilot Extension Telemetry but block all others. Also they would need to be able to control this on oganization level with policies.

Language servers like gopls use Hints for code modernization suggestions (e.g., ""use slices.Contains instead of loop""), but there's no way to see these in the Problems panel.

https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/settings#Analyzer.Severity
says:
> Importantly, Hint diagnostics do not appear in the Problems tab in VS Code, so they are less intrusive than Info diagnostics. The rule of thumb is this: use Info if the diagnostic is not a bug, but the author probably didn't mean to write the code that way. Use Hint if the diagnostic is not a bug and the author intended to write the code that way, but there is a simpler or more modern way to express the same logic. An 'unused' diagnostic is Info level, since the author probably didn't mean to check in unreachable code. A 'modernize' or 'deprecated' diagnostic is Hint level, since the author intended to write the code that way, but now there is a better way. 

Those `DiagnosticSeverity.Hint` don't appear in the Problems panel, and there is no way to see all of them in one place. 
The only available filters are: Show Errors, Show Warnings and Show Infos

Can we add a fourth checkbox the to Show Hints, that will be unchecked by default?

That would allow users to see all code improvement suggestions project-wide.

I can see those hints per file, but it would be nice to optionally see all of them  right in the problems pane

Type: <b>Bug</b>

With tab sizing set to ""fit"" with multiple tab rows, the last tab in the row sometimes leaves a big gap at the end of the row due to the tab size taking up the remainder of the row with spaces.  This causes an unnecessary wrap of the next tab when there is plenty of room for the next tab to fit.   If the last tab would do a proper fit based on its content length, this wouldn't be a problem, but it appears to pad itself to occupy the remainder of the row.

3497122546,Centralize error notifications in VS Code prompt area for MCP servers,"### Summary
Currently, MCP server errors in the VS Code prompt area use two inconsistent patterns: a tool icon that opens a quick pick view, and a server icon that shows messages on delayed hover. This creates confusion about how to access error information and makes the interface feel unresponsive. We should consolidate these into a single, central error notification pattern.
Context/Background
Users working with MCP servers encounter errors displayed through different UI patterns in the prompt area. The inconsistency leads to:

Unclear affordances - users don't know what action to take when they see an error
Perceived broken functionality - the hover delay makes the interface feel unresponsive
Cognitive overhead - learning two different interaction patterns for the same type of information

### Description
Current State:

<img width=""1196"" height=""502"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56be94e8-3165-4cb7-83f7-a26c0bc3c8c9"" />

Tool icon error: Clicking opens a quick pick view with error details (immediate feedback)
Server icon error: Hovering displays error message after a delay (delayed feedback)

### Desired State:
A unified error notification system that:

- Uses a single, consistent interaction pattern for all MCP server errors
- Provides immediate, clear feedback when errors occur
- Makes it obvious to users that there are errors and how to view them
- Displays error information in a centralized location


<img width=""674"" height=""196"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d72e4da-dae4-4176-b1b6-fc92ccd586ef"" />


### Acceptance Criteria

-  All MCP server errors use the same notification mechanism
-  Error notification provides immediate visual feedback (no perceived lag)
-  Users can access detailed error information through a single, consistent interaction
-  Error notification clearly indicates the number and type of errors present
-  Interaction pattern is discoverable and follows VS Code conventions

**Area:** Copilot Chat / Model Selection

### 🚀 Problem Statement

Currently, selecting the desired underlying Large Language Model (LLM) for a chat session requires selecting from a long list of models, especially if one is relying on multiple providers.

This experience is inefficient, non-user-friendly, and lacks the ability for users to prioritize and quickly switch between their most-used models for different tasks (e.g., a ""Code Review"" model vs. a ""Creative Writing"" model).

### ✅ Proposed Solution: Three Key Enhancements

We propose adding a user-configurable settings panel (likely in `settings.json` under a new key like `copilot.chat.modelManagement`) to implement the following features:

#### 1. Model Aliases (User-Friendly Naming)
Allow users to define short, human-readable aliases for complex model IDs.

* **Benefit:** Allows for instant recognition and faster selection.
* **Example Configuration:**
    ```json
    ""copilot.chat.modelManagement.aliases"": {
        ""gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20"": ""Gemini: Flash (Fast)"",
        ""gpt-4o-2024-05-13"": ""GPT-4o (Default)"",
        ""claude-3-sonnet-20240229"": ""Claude: Sonnet (Creative)""
    }
    ```
The list of models would continue to be sorted alphabetically.

#### 2. Model Favorites (Quick Access List)
Allow users to designate a subset of models as ""Favorites.""

* **Benefit:** In the chat input box model picker, the favorited models appear at the top in the manual order that they were specified. All other models are shown alphabetically below as indicated in #1.

#### 3. Auto-Selection based on Favorites List and Retry
Enhance the current model auto-selection logic by allowing users to allow model selection based on favorites list. If any model errors out (especially due to API limits), the agent's recent activity (if there was any activity) would be erased and then re-performed with the next model.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/270440,1

This is unfortunately not workable, as Key-based Auth is disabled for our entire org due to our latest security wave, and enabling it will create an incident asking me to undo it.
 
Instead of Key-based Auth support which we're moving away from, could we please add Entra ID based support when trying to add an Azure deployment?
Under the hood, the key/token can be grabbed from user's Entra ID with the ""https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"" scope.

Let's simply come up with an **advanced settings** concept. An advanced setting should be still registered with an `advanced: true` property. But:

- By default, users should not be able to discover advanced settings via the Settings UI or JSON editor.
- Unless they toggle `View advanced settings` (this can either be a setting or a global state value).
- (Optional) Insiders have `View advanced settings` set to `true`, by default.

AGENT always creates MD files even though I write in the instructions, that IT shouldn't (probably system prompt says so).

Added forbidden_operations to the chatmode YAML frontmatter.
What this does:

Declares that create_file tool is forbidden for patterns: docs/**/*.md and **/*.drawio
Declares that replace_string_in_file tool is forbidden for pattern: docs/**
Important caveats:
⚠️ This is declarative only - VS Code/Copilot needs to implement enforcement of this field
Currently, this is just metadata - I can still see the rule, but nothing technically blocks me from violating it
This is the right place to put the rule for future enforcement when the feature is implemented

I believe that visual studio code should have a refresh button, most of the time many issues are solved my just reloading the window. Which I find counter productive because not only do I have close the current working file (which in some cases hampers my work or in middle of writing, obviously after saving ) or when I'm running some local server. 

Also visual studio code get heavy after working on it (like adding internal/external extensions), so in windows it gets painful to open it.  Thankfully I use Linux so I do not have much but my office computer is in windows so yeah.

By the way, I was not talking about the operating system issue rather the internal issues like copy paste not working, extensions not instantly working, updates getting stuck.

I believe adding a simple reload button or right-click reload option will work fine. Also while you are at it, make updates once or twice a month.

I have to work with my C++ project on both Windows and Linux. So far the only problem with it that I have is debugging options. I'm debugging it at once on both systems (remotely, in separate VS Code windows connected to vscode server through SSH) and I keep confusing what system I'm currently debuging and I'm clicking on wrong launch option. Currently there's no way for me to stop this from happening. I can't even create a shared debug profile that will satisfy my requirements for both systems, I have to use specific one for each system. The `linux` and `windows` blocks inside launch configuration didn't really help much since you can't use `type` parameter inside any of those blocks, hence I can't specify `cppvsdbg` type for Windows and `cppdbg` for Linux. What I'm trying to say is, it would be nice to have optional global parameter for every launch type to hide it from the list on specific system. Something like:

When source code is managed by Perforce, all files are marked read-only until the user attempts to edit the file, at which time a ""p4 open"" is performed on the file and the file is marked writeable.

When delegating to a cloud agent, I attached the message `Go for it! Note when you submit the PR, ensure it will close the following issue when merged: https://github.com/benvillalobos/bv/issues/1`, but it did not include a ""Fixes [issue link]"" in the description.


This was the PR description it generated:
-----
Problem
Strikethrough text (using ~~text~~ syntax) was not rendering properly in blog posts. Instead of displaying with strikethrough formatting, the raw markdown syntax was shown to users.

For example, in the camping post, items like:

- ~~Rubber mit~~
- ~~Daiso Water Jugs~~
Were displaying as literal ~~text~~ instead of strikethrough text.

Solution
The default react-markdown component doesn't support GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions like strikethrough. To enable this feature, I:

Installed the remark-gfm plugin - This adds support for GFM features including strikethrough, tables, task lists, and autolinks
Updated Post.tsx to pass the plugin to the ReactMarkdown component
Changes
// Before
<ReactMarkdown>{markdown}</ReactMarkdown>

// After
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
<ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}>{markdown}</ReactMarkdown>
Result
Strikethrough text now renders correctly with proper formatting:

Strikethrough working

Items like ""Canopy"" and ""Copper Spur UL3 Tent"" now display with strikethrough formatting instead of showing the raw markdown syntax.

Additional Benefits
Beyond strikethrough, this change also enables other useful GFM features:

Tables
Task lists (checkboxes)
Autolink literals
Footnotes

Current state: set `""github.copilot.chat.advanced.claudeCode.enabled"": true` and use from the chat sessions view

### Required for a basically usable experience
- Needs all the polish of different tool confirmation types, eg for terminals, with the same auto-approve logic
- Track edits
	- Apply our logic for allowing edits inside the workspace
	- But requiring confirmation for certain files (how to do this when the agent is editing the file?)
	- The agent editing files that are unsaved in vscode?

### Polish
- `/ide` context eg open files, tools to integrate with editor
  - Not sure if it should be based on us implementing the websocket protocol that CC uses or just installing the official CC extension
- Support multi-root via `additionalDirectories`
- Show background bash shells (`/bashes`)?
- Slash commands
  - `/compact`
  - `/memory`
- Manage agents, show subtasks. The user's configured agents are used by the sdk
- Start and manage a claude code agent on a different directory (eg worktree)
- Support custom `/` commands
- Test all types of vscode attachments
- Enable mcp servers configured in vscode
- Fully use streaming mode to use same CC process across requests, timing out at some point
- Align Bash command approval with vscode's auto-approval as configured by the user
- Show tool invocation progress in a nicer way (currently tool calls only show up when done)
- Linkify response
- Show terminal output

## Open questions
- How integrated is this experience with vscode? Is it totally aligned with how the vscode agent is configured, or is it just ""claude code in vscode"", configured as CC typically is? 
- Session storage- we read sessions from `~/.claude`, but the vscode requests have some of their own metadata that I don't have anywhere to store, so things like attachments on the original request can't be restored https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/264816
- Conversation summaries don't work because it looks like claude code doesn't respect the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var for these requests
- We redirect haiku requests to gpt-4o-mini but it has a much lower prompt token limit than expected, so these sometimes fail
- Branding, icons, etc
- Our Claude 4 has a much smaller context window than what Claude Code assumes. We adjust the reported token usage so that auto-compact will be triggered correctly, but it's still a bit off because after compaction, the conversation gets resized so a size that Claude Code thinks is safe, but is actually still a bit close to our context limit.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/268785,1

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

I would like to suggest an improvement for Visual Studio Code Live Share and GitHub Copilot integration.

Please consider adding features for shared Copilot chat and integrated voice support in Live Share for a more seamless collaborative experience.

3456806317,Option to show the Test Results explorer pane with its tree view on the left side,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

#### Background

When I open the Test Results panel at the bottom, its internal ""sidebar"" (the tree / list of test runs and test items) appears on the right-hand side. Each time I use it, I get disoriented because in most applications, panels that combine a tree and details, the tree or navigation list is on the left and the details/content is on the right. Having the test run list on the right feels inverted relative to muscle memory and common UI patterns. This makes quick scanning and navigation slower and mildly frustrating.

#### Proposal

Add a user/workspace setting and/or a compact toggle button in the Test Results view toolbar to choose the layout orientation, for example:

```
""testing.resultsView.layout"": ""treeLeft"" | ""treeRight"" (default: ""treeRight"")
```

When set to `treeLeft`, the test run / test item explorer column would be rendered on the left, with the selected test output/details on the right.

#### Benefits

- Consistency: Aligns with the mental model established by the Explorer, Debug, Git, and Extensions views.
- Usability: Reduces cognitive friction and cursor travel—eyes start at left for hierarchical navigation.
- Low risk: Purely optional; default can remain as-is to avoid surprising existing users.

Problem: Users currently must wait for each chat response to fully complete before submitting their next prompt, creating inefficient workflow interruptions.

Solution: Implement a prompt queue system that allows users to submit multiple prompts while a conversation is processing. Queued prompts execute sequentially—each prompt waits for the previous response to complete before automatically proceeding.
Key Requirements:

* Enable prompt submission during active chat processing
* Execute queued prompts in sequential order (not parallel)
* Automatically trigger next prompt when previous response completes
* Provide visual queue status and progress indicators

User Benefit: Eliminates wait time between prompts, enabling users to batch their questions and maintain workflow momentum without manual intervention between each exchange.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/268343,1

If I'm using the **Accessible View** to read a response from **Copilot Chat** and switch to another application for any reason and then switch back to **VS Code**, focus does not return to the **Accessible View**.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open **Copilot Chat** and type a query. For example, ask for a list of all the planets in the solar system.
2. Once the chat is done generating, open the **Accessible View**, and place the cursor on **Mars**.
3. Switch to another application using **Alt+Tab**.
4. Return to the **VS Code** window using **Alt+Tab**.

#### Current Behavior

Keyboard focus lands on the list of messages, causing me to lose my place in the **Accessible View**.

#### Expected Behavior

The keyboard focus should remain in the **Accessible View** component with the cursor on the same word.

Even though the copilot token is cached, this call is very slow as it uses vscode API and reaches into the renderer process. We measured it in some completions/nes scenarios and saw that this call takes between `20ms` and `120ms`. This has a huge impact on features like completions and NES which need to run very fast.

3445516032,Terminal auto-approve should parse shell command arguments for more granular trust,"The terminal's command approval feature doesn't inspect the arguments passed to shell executables like `pwsh.exe`, `bash`, etc. When GitHub Copilot suggests a command that wraps an actual command in a shell-invoking syntax (e.g., `pwsh.exe -Command ""dotnet test path_to_csproj""`), the approval mechanism only recognizes `pwsh.exe` as the command, not the `dotnet test` part inside the string.

This leads to a poor user experience and a potential security issue. To use the auto-approve feature effectively, the user is forced to add the shell executable itself (e.g., `pwsh.exe`) to the allowed list. This effectively disables the security check for *any* command executed through that shell, undermining the purpose of the feature.

The desired behavior would be for the approval system to be intelligent enough to parse the command line, identify the actual command being executed within the shell's argument, and check *that* command against the approval list.

#### **Steps to Reproduce:**

1.  Add a specific, safe command to the list of approved commands in your settings. For example, add `dotnet test` to `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove`.
2.  Have Copilot execute a command in the following format:
    ```powershell
    pwsh.exe -Command ""dotnet test C:/proj/proj.csproj""
    ```

#### **Expected Behavior**

The command executes without a security prompt because the core command being run, `dotnet test`, is already on the approved list.

#### **Actual Behavior**

A security prompt appears asking whether to trust this command. The system fails to recognize that the underlying command is the already-approved `dotnet test`. This forces the user to either:
a) Enable auto-approve for `pwsh.exe` itself, which would allow any future command run via `pwsh.exe -Command` to execute without a prompt.
b) Enable auto-approve for the exact command, which would be problematic, because there may be a lot of different parameters passed to `dotnet test`.
c) Manually approve the command every time, which makes the auto-approve feature redundant for this common, AI-generated pattern.

#### **Proposed Solution**

I propose that the terminal's trust mechanism be enhanced to detect and parse commands for common shell execution patterns. It should look for patterns such as:

  * `pwsh.exe -Command ""[COMMAND]""`
  * `powershell.exe -Command ""[COMMAND]""`
  * `bash -c ""[COMMAND]""`
  * `sh -c ""[COMMAND]""`
  * `zsh -c ""[COMMAND]""`
  * `cmd.exe /c ""[COMMAND]""`

When one of these patterns is detected, the trust validation should be performed on the `[COMMAND]` part, not on the shell executable.

-----

#### **Regarding Existing Workarounds**

I am aware that this issue can be partially mitigated by using regular expressions in the `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` setting. However, this approach is not a sufficient solution for two main reasons:

1.  **Poor User Experience:** It requires users to write and maintain potentially complex regular expressions. The goal of the trust feature should be convenience and security that is accessible through the UI (e.g., the confirmation prompt), not just through advanced configuration in `settings.json`.
2.  **Redundancy:** To be comprehensive, a user would need to define the same core command multiple times for different shells. For instance, allowing `dotnet test` would require separate regex entries for `pwsh.exe -Command ""dotnet test""`, `bash -c ""dotnet test""`, `cmd.exe /c ""dotnet test""`, etc. The ideal solution is to approve a command like `dotnet test` **once**, and have the system recognize it regardless of the shell wrapper.

A native implementation of this parsing logic would provide a much more robust, secure, and user-friendly experience out-of-the-box, especially as AI-assisted terminal usage becomes more common.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/267975,1

3433328758,OS-Level Notifications for VSCode Tasks Completion,"## Summary

I would like to suggest adding OS-level notifications to VSCode that alert users when long-running [tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks) complete execution. This would significantly improve the developer experience by allowing users to multitask while waiting for builds, tests, or other time-consuming operations to finish. 

<img  height=""500"" alt=""demo of os level notification when vscode task completes"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cda8bb5c-70ee-4283-b0a6-e91a642968af"" />

## Problem Statement

For example, my Expo app build process (`eas build --local --platform ios`) currently takes approximately 8 minutes to complete. During this time, I often need to:
- Read documentation
- Write some Jira 🤭 tickets
- Review code in other applications
- etc

Without OS-level notifications, I frequently miss when builds complete, leading to inefficient workflow and lost productivity.

<img  height=""500"" alt=""npm script takes 8 minutes on avarage"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4f9682-03b1-425f-aa06-7afab661e849"" />

## Proposed Solution

Add native OS-level notification support for VSCode [Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks) completion, including:

- Show system notifications when any VSCode task finishes (success, failure, or cancellation)
- Support all task types: builds, tests, npm scripts, terminal commands, AI Agent operations
- Configurable settings to enable/disable and customize notifications

## Motivation

This feature would be particularly valuable for:

- **Build Processes**: Long-running compilation and build tasks
- **Test Suites**: Comprehensive test runs that may take several minutes
- **AI Agent Operations**: As mentioned in [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/157286#discussioncomment-13372951), users find OS notifications ""extremely valuable"" for AI agents that can take ""30 seconds to 5 minutes or more to complete each task."" Although this example is for AI agent tasks, it is also applicable to npm tasks.
- **Custom Scripts**: Any long-running npm scripts or custom automation

## Benefits

- **Improved Productivity**: Developers can multitask without losing track of running processes
- **Better User Experience**: Reduces the need to constantly monitor task progress
- **Cross-Application Awareness**: Notifications work even when VSCode is not the active application. Example: [Notifications](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/common-capabilities#display-notifications), which displays brief information in the bottom right of VS Code. However, these notifications cannot be seen if VSCode is not focused.
- **Consistency**: Aligns with modern development tools and user expectations

## Related Work

- [Feature Request: Audio Notifications for GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250915) - While this was closed as not planned, visual notifications may be more universally useful than audio
- VSCode forks like Cursor already implement similar notification features for AI agent completion

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

I use a multi root workspace with many code sources and I repeatedly find myself in need of a way to customize the order of the repositories in the source control view.

The two main code sources are on a network path, so very occasionally, they can briefly become unreachable.
Sorting by discovery time had worked in the past, until this happens. At that point I have no sorting option that makes sense for the way I work.

I like the way that folders can be specified for a workspace and I think a similar approach to this would work well. Actually, even being able to sort by the same order that's in the the folders definitions would be great. In my case most of the repos I use are picked up when adding a new folder.

For a time, I somewhat worked around this by showing and hiding the repos, since doing so would send it to the bottom of the list. However, since then, behavior has changed such that each time vscode is opened, the repos are sorted in a particular order. So my previous workaround is no longer viable.

Thank you!",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/267374,1

Integrate this feature natively into VS Code to show the focused file's size directly in the status bar.

```dotenv
# This is a comment

```

Unlike other languages, files of this type are not recognizable by a name **suffix** (file extension). Instead, these files are typically recognizable by a name **prefix**. Some popular file names include:

- `.env`
- `.env.development`
- `.env.production`
- `.env.test`
- `.env.local`
- `.env.development.local`
- `.env.production.local`
- `.env.test.local`
- `.flaskenv`
- `user-dirs.dirs`

This format is supported by many popular environments, including the Node.js, Next.js, Flask, and the XDG user dir specification.

There are two popular existing Dotenv extensions:

- [DotENV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv)
- [Dotenv Official +Vault](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dotenv.dotenv-vscode)

The most popular is _DotENV_. It doesn’t specify the correct file patterns. Instead, it defines [extensions](https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vscode/blob/v0.28.1/package.json#L109-L162). This extension was last updated 7 years ago.

The extension _Dotenv Official +Vault_ looks more official. It has the same problem as _DotENV_, but additionally it writes to user settings as a workaround. This is solved by https://github.com/dotenv-org/dotenv-vscode/pull/105, but this has gone unnoticed for over a year.

3424554742,Add Dynamic HTML Chat View to Replace Accessible View for Screen Reader Users,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>


# **Add Dynamic HTML Chat View to Replace Accessible View for Screen Reader Users**

### **Subtitle**

Eliminate the static Accessible View in favor of an integrated, scrollable, copyable chat transcript with headings, actionable links, sound cues, and seamless F6 toggling — dramatically improving accessibility, efficiency, and user experience.

---

## Triage Summary

This proposal replaces the current static Accessible View used for chat responses with a dynamic, scrollable HTML transcript view inside the chat panel. It introduces headings for quick navigation, actionable links/buttons, copy/paste support, polite live updates, an optional sound cue for “Working…”, and seamless F6 toggling between chat input and transcript without losing place.
Shipping it behind an experimental setting (`""chat.experimentalHTMLAccessibleView""`) would allow early testing and feedback from screen reader users, helping close a major accessibility gap and set a new standard for inclusive developer tooling.

---

## Motivation

&#x20;has built a reputation as one of the most accessible and inclusive developer environments available. The proposed change continues that leadership by addressing one of the last major friction points for screen reader users: accessing chat responses.
Replacing the static, modal **Accessible View** with a **dynamic, scrollable, interactive HTML chat view** aligns perfectly with VS Code’s goals of efficiency, inclusivity, and seamless productivity. It would modernize the chat experience while preserving the product’s commitment to first-class accessibility for all.

---

## Steps to Reproduce Current Problem

1. Open a chat session (such as with ) inside VS Code.
2. Submit a prompt and wait for a response.
3. Attempt to read the response with a screen reader.
4. Notice that:

   * You must open **Accessible View** to read the content.
   * The response opens in a **separate static document** instead of remaining inline in the chat panel.
   * Links and buttons are presented as **plain text** and are not actionable.
   * There is **no heading structure** to navigate between prompts and responses.
   * Copy/paste is cumbersome or unreliable.
   * The screen reader announces **“Working …”** which often collides with other tooling announcements.
   * Returning to the chat panel closes the Accessible View and loses your position in both.

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

|                   | Expected Behavior                                                 | Actual Behavior                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Reading responses | Can be read directly in the chat panel                            | Must open a separate Accessible View                  |
| Navigation        | Continuous scrolling and heading navigation across responses      | Static single-response document, no heading structure |
| Links and buttons | Exposed as focusable actionable elements                          | Shown as plain text, not actionable                   |
| Copy/paste        | Standard text selection and copy supported                        | Inconsistent or blocked                               |
| Announcements     | Optional soft sound cue for “Working …”                           | Spoken “Working …” interrupts other announcements     |
| Focus behavior    | F6 toggles between chat input and transcript without losing place | Opening/closing Accessible View loses focus/position  |

---

## Summary

Currently, screen reader users must open a static Accessible View to read chat responses, which disrupts workflow, prevents continuous scrolling, and makes links and buttons unusable. I propose adding a dynamic HTML-based chat view inside the chat panel itself that allows scrolling, text selection, copy/paste, and proper heading-based navigation, while rendering links and buttons as actionable elements. It would support polite live updates, replace the disruptive “Working …” spoken announcement with an optional soft sound cue, and allow quick F6-based toggling between the chat input area and this transcript view without losing place, greatly improving accessibility and efficiency.

---

## Describe the feature you’d like to request

Introduce a **dynamic HTML-based view** for chat responses that:

* Stays inside the chat panel (no context switch to Accessible View)
* Supports **continuous scrolling, selection, and copy/paste**
* Renders **links and buttons as focusable actionable elements**
* Uses **headings for user prompts and responses** to enable quick screen reader navigation
* Provides **polite live updates** without stealing focus
* Allows **F6 to switch between the chat input area and the transcript view** while **preserving focus position** in both places
* **Replaces “Working …” spoken announcements with an optional soft non-verbal sound cue** to avoid collisions with other screen reader or tooling announcements

---

## Describe the problem this feature would solve

**Current experience:**

* Requires opening **Accessible View** to read chat responses, which takes users out of the chat panel.
* Returning to the chat panel requires closing Accessible View, which is disruptive and disorienting.
* The view is static, so users cannot scroll continuously through multiple responses.
* Text is often difficult to copy/paste from.
* **Links and buttons are presented as plain text**, not actionable elements, and cannot be activated by keyboard.
* There is **no heading structure** to distinguish user prompts from assistant responses, preventing fast navigation with screen reader heading commands.
* Live streaming responses sometimes **steal focus**, and the **“Working …” spoken announcement interrupts** other screen reader or tooling output.

**Resulting impact:**

* Significantly reduced efficiency and productivity for screen reader and keyboard-only users.
* Difficult to navigate, copy, or act on content within the chat experience.

---

## Describe the benefits this feature would bring

* Provides a **single, continuous reading surface** for all chat responses directly in the chat panel.
* Allows **standard navigation, selection, and copy/paste** like a typical webpage.
* Makes **links and buttons usable and discoverable** by keyboard and screen reader users.
* Provides **heading-based navigation** (e.g. `<h2>` for user prompts, `<h3>` for assistant responses), allowing quick jumps between messages.
* Eliminates **context switching and disorientation** caused by Accessible View.
* **Soft sound cue** avoids announcement collisions while still giving progress feedback.
* **F6 toggling** enables smooth movement between the compose area and the reading area without losing position in either.

---

## Additional context

**Implementation suggestions:**

* Use `main` landmark for the transcript region and `aria-live=""polite""` for streamed tokens.
* Provide visible focus indicators and semantic `<a>` and `<button>` elements for interactive content.
* Ensure full keyboard navigation support and compatibility with screen reader virtual/browse modes.

**Experimental rollout suggestion:**

* Consider shipping this feature **behind an experimental flag or setting** so it can be tested by screen reader users early without affecting the default experience.
* This would allow real-world feedback before fully replacing Accessible View for chat responses.

**Testing considerations:**

* Screen reader audit: headings, landmarks, links, focus, live regions
* Keyboard audit: tab order, F6 toggling, activation, copy/paste
* Collision test: verify that the soft sound cue does not overlap with other announcements
* Regression check: ensure Accessible View still works for other components

---

## Proposed Setting Name and Default

```jsonc
""chat.experimentalHTMLAccessibleView"": false
```

* When `true`, enables the new dynamic HTML-based accessible chat view described above.
* Defaults to `false` so that only users who opt in (particularly screen reader users) will see it during early testing.
* Can later become the default experience once stabilized and validated.

---

## Key Metrics for Success

* **Task efficiency:** Measurable reduction in time required for screen reader users to read multi-turn chat sessions end-to-end.
* **Navigation speed:** Increased use of heading navigation (H/Shift+H) to move between user and assistant messages.
* **Error reduction:** Significant decrease in reported focus loss, accidental mode switching, or lost context while reading.
* **Engagement:** Increased usage of chat features among users who have screen reader mode enabled.
* **User satisfaction:** Positive accessibility feedback through VS Code’s feedback channels, GitHub issues, and user studies.

---

## Call to Action

This feature represents an opportunity to close a critical accessibility gap and set a new benchmark for inclusive design in developer tooling.
By implementing it behind an experimental flag and gathering early user feedback, the  team can lead the industry in providing a seamless, fully navigable, and screen reader–first chat experience—demonstrating that accessibility and productivity can advance hand in hand.

I would be happy to **meet with the VS Code team, provide user feedback, and help iterate on the design and implementation** to ensure this feature ships at the highest possible quality.

3407398361,Improve AI Chat experience: simplify modes & optimize layout integration,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>


I have two suggestions for improving the AI Chat experience in VS Code:

Unify modes into Agent only

After the introduction of Agent mode, the other two modes feel redundant.

Having just one consistent mode (Agent) would reduce complexity and make the UX clearer.

Optimize chat layout for workspace usability

The current chat panel takes up too much space and requires frequent toggling to view files and workspace content.

I suggest splitting the chat UI into two lightweight parts:

Chat input (conversation area) could be integrated into the Explorer / workspace management view, right under the file list.

Chat output (conversation results) could be displayed directly in the Terminal panel.

This would minimize space usage and make chat feel more naturally embedded in the developer workflow.

We do have `mcpServerDefinitionProviders` listed in the `package.json` (and register an MCP server upon activation), but it doesn't make sense that we are now always activated.

For example here's all the output before my tests start running. Many of these ""errors"" are not relevant and don't affect the tests at all. There's also some output duplicated, and the ID of every extension is printed multiple times.

While this output might be useful in some cases, 99% of the time it's irrelevant and some kind of `--quiet` flag to hide it would help (both LLMs, and users reviewing logs to see their test failures).

In the rearrangeButtons logic of `src/vs/base/browser/ui/dialog/dialog.ts`, it is not possible to place the Cancel button on the left side when there are more than two buttons. This restricts UI flexibility for dialogs with three or more buttons, which may require Cancel to be leftmost for consistency or accessibility reasons.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Use a dialog with three or more buttons (e.g., OK, Cancel, Custom).
2. Attempt to place Cancel on the left by adjusting button order.
3. Observe that rearrangeButtons does not allow Cancel to be placed leftmost unless there are only two buttons.

#### Expected Behavior
- The Cancel button should be allowed to be placed as the leftmost button even if there are more than two buttons.

#### Actual Behavior
- rearrangeButtons logic restricts Cancel to only be leftmost if there are exactly two buttons.

#### Suggested Fix
- Update rearrangeButtons logic to allow Cancel to be placed first regardless of button count, or provide option/configuration for button order.

I use the picker a lot. I basically don't use tabs except to close them or to check if they are unsaved documents. 

So it's very important for me that file switching is very easy and intuitive.

And I feel like it is still not there, I have to stop and think a little to what file I am trying to get back to.

And I just had an idea that might make this better.

It would be nice if the last function edited was included in the file item of the picker (ctrl+p)  (When I say picker I mean palette).

For instance, if I edited `App.edit_name = () {....}` this information could be included as a separate column/row of the item, I don't mind if the items are a bit bigger.

So now I have at a glance the last lines I touched of all recent files.

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

Currently, configuring models in GitHub Copilot's chat interface requires users to access settings through a popup, where they must select a model provider, enter API keys, and choose models separately. This process is cumbersome and disrupts the workflow. With the existing settings icon in Copilot, it would be more user-friendly to integrate model configuration as a submenu under this icon, opening the configuration directly within the current chat page. This could consolidate API key input and model list display in one streamlined view, reducing steps and improving usability. Such an enhancement would make model switching more intuitive and efficient for developers.

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

GitHub Copilot's chat history is currently sorted by time, making it hard to access key conversations quickly. A pin feature would allow users to pin important sessions to the top for better organization.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
I need to be able to replace entire section with agent instructions, especially on `execution`.

I have trouble with agent running off and doing random things, **despite** having MD plan, where at the end of each step there is specific instruction to pause execution and wait for the human to review, test and validate.

The culprit might be this single line, which costs me time every day, instead of saving:

Every single day I have to fight this line of instructions. I like simplicity and deep integration of VSCode Copilot, but I'm at the point where I will start looking for alternatives, maybe give Cline another run.

More generally - VSCode Copilot agent will be much more useful for me and my team, if I can edit entire system prompts. Not **extend** it.  **Edit** it. But right now - I need to edit that single line of instructions.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/265642,1

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

**Feature request**:

When an editor group has been manually shrunk by dragging its divider, focusing that group using ""View: Focus Next Editor Group"" (keyboard shortcut) restores/un-minimizes it, to an even larger size than it started. I cannot find a setting to prevent this behavior.

Use case: I arrange editor groups to specific sizes for my workflow. Automatic resizing when cycling focus requires me to stop using the keyboard and manually resize dividers with the mouse, and disrupts flow and context.

Typically I make them smaller to get a temporarily unneeded group of open tabs out of the way, meaning I don't want to see it again until I manually drag it back.

Request: Please add an option to disable automatic resizing of editor group sizes when changing focus, or provide a setting to preserve manual sizes exactly. A preference like ""workbench.editor.preserveGroupSizesOnFocus"": true would address this.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open at least two editor groups.
2. Drag the divider to make one group very small.
3. Focus the small group using ""View: Focus Next Editor Group"" (keyboard shortcut).

Expected/desired: Focus moves without changing the manually set group sizes.
Observed: The small group is expanded/restored automatically.

**Video**: Here is a video from 2018 demonstrating the same automatic resizing (that commenter likes it!): https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/53702#issuecomment-403017412

3389233447,Add Native Support for Database Querying and Schema Exploration in VS Code,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

While extensions for database management are widely used in VS Code, integrating native support for querying databases and exploring schemas directly within the editor would greatly simplify workflows for developers. This feature could include built-in SQL query execution, schema visualization, and connection management, reducing the need for external tools or multiple extensions. By providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, VS Code would enhance productivity, especially for data-intensive projects, and offer a more seamless experience similar to specialized IDEs. This addition would benefit users across various database types like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, making VS Code an even more versatile development environment.

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

The current chat history in GitHub Copilot is displayed as a simple list, which feels too basic for users navigating through past conversations. Switching to a card-based layout would provide better visual separation between sessions, making it easier to scan, preview, and access individual chats while improving overall usability. Each card could display richer information, such as token usage, number of conversation turns, summaries, or timestamps, similar to modern messaging apps, to give users quick insights without needing to open the full session. This enhancement would streamline workflow and provide more context at a glance, ultimately boosting productivity without overwhelming the interface.

3368263838,Automatic File Recreation in Copilot Agent Mode make entire codebase was rolled back to a previous version. lost hours of work,"Description:
GitHub Copilot Agent Mode currently recreates deleted files when reopening a chat session or restarting VS Code. While this may be intended to preserve context, it can lead to serious disruptions—especially when files were intentionally removed or modified.
Problem:
- Deleted files are automatically restored as empty or outdated versions.
- This behavior persists across VS Code restarts and chat thread reopens.
- In some cases, entire code changes are reverted to an earlier state, causing loss of work.
- There is no current setting to opt out of this behavior.
Personal Use Case:
During a recent session, I deleted a file and made significant changes across my project. Upon restarting VS Code and revisiting Copilot Agent, the deleted file was recreated—and worse, my entire codebase was rolled back to a previous version. I lost hours of work. This behavior feels intrusive and undermines trust in the tool.
Proposed Solution:
Introduce a toggle or configuration option in the Copilot extension settings to disable automatic file recreation in Agent Mode. For example:
""copilot.agent.restoreDeletedFiles"": false

This would allow users to maintain full control over their workspace and avoid unintended file restoration or rollback.
Benefits:
- Prevents accidental loss of work.
- Empowers users to manage their own file lifecycle.
- Supports cleaner, more predictable workflows.
- Builds trust in Copilot Agent’s behavior.
Additional Notes:
This issue has been discussed in [#251284](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251284), but a fix is currently not planned. A toggle would offer a middle ground—preserving functionality for those who want it, while giving others the option to opt out.

This is early and we are still exploring this with many developers that are already deep into planning and context engineering, devx teams that want to make AI tools easier to use out of the box, and developers who have never heard of ""plan mode"" or ""context engineering"". _Please keep the feedback and ideas coming as we explore this._

Naming: Spec, Research, Plan?

**Assumptions:**
- **Should be default enabled**:
  - Plan modes are a context engineering best practice for higher user confidence and AI output quality
  - Many users don't discover toggles or settings for optional features
  - Could this mode the new default, replacing _Ask_ mode? Maybe not, as it would focus on always re-iterating the full revised  plan.
- **Simple plan-iterate-accept first**: Works for most users and scales from most plans, doesn't overwhelm with structure and follows established best practices
   - Iteratation between user and agent to reduce ambiguitity and refine the scope for the given task, letting the user accept the plan when they feel comfortable with the scope
- **Customized plan workflow**: Planning often needs context beyond the codebase or built-in read-only tools
  - Settings for a) allow additional tools during planning, b) customize approach with a template plan or instructions
  - Fully replace default mode with custom mode (customize instructions, tools, etc from scratch), allows power-user spec-driven development flows
- **Progressive planning depth (Later)**: Most planning needs are solved with in-chat plans, but deeper/broader planning with file artifacts allows the LLM to track more angles, go deeper in research and expand on its thinking
  - Persistent planning artifacts can tackle higher complexity and longer running tasks
  - Spec/intent-driven AI development is still being explored in various very opionated approaches
  - Could be set as default and use mode-based customizations (create new branch, per-feature doc folders, spec/design/implementation docs, attach plan to issue)

3364086386,Accessibility: macOS `Problem` tooltip does not support opening an accessible view,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

On macOS using VoiceOver, if I am in a file that has an error, when I press `F8`, it sometimes is read aloud, sometimes not. But, if I try to open an accessible view to read the error message, nothing happens.

To reprodoce, first open a file that has an error reported by VS Code, where `F8` would jump to it and open a tooltip. Then, press `Option + F2`. Notice that no accessible view opens.

The accessible view seems to open everywhere else, except for problems, making issues unreadable.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

I'd like the ""References Code Lens"" to also display **the number of files** in which the function is referenced.

Sometimes the number of references alone is not too helpful, because a function can be used in a single context (class, function) multiple times -- which makes refactoring rather easy, and sometimes it can be used in multiple contexts once -- which makes refactoring harder. Or sometimes the other way round, you know how it's like. My point is that the number of files can be a helpful additional information that lets you quickly assess the impact of potential modifications.

I'd see this either as a separate setting, next to `typescript.referencesCodeLens.enabled` (e.g. `typescript.referencesCodeLens.show[NumberOf]Files`, or it could be a non-configurable addition to the existing feature. 

Before:


_5 references_

<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
## Problem
The current markdown workflow has usability issues:

1. **Double-click interference**: Double-clicking in markdown preview (e.g., to select/copy text or follow links) switches back to editor view, which is disruptive when working extensively with markdown files and internal links.

2. **Missing return shortcut**: While `Ctrl+Shift+V` opens markdown preview, there's no default shortcut to return to the editor from preview mode.

3. **Tab clutter**: Having separate tabs for normal view and rendered view creates tab bloat, especially when working with multiple files.

## Current Workaround
I've disabled the double-click behavior with:
```json
""markdown.preview.doubleClickToSwitchToEditor"": false
```

And created a custom keybinding:
```json
[
  {
    ""key"": ""ctrl+shift+v"",
    ""command"": ""markdown.showEditor"",
    ""when"": ""activeEditor == 'workbench.editor.markdown.previewEditor'""
  }
]
```

## Proposed Solution
**Add `Ctrl+Shift+V` as a native toggle** between markdown preview and editor modes. This makes logical sense because:
- Same shortcut works both ways (no confusion)
- No conflict when in preview mode (the shortcut isn't used there)
- Intuitive toggle behavior users expect

## Additional Considerations
The dual-tab approach feels outdated compared to modern markdown editors. A **single-file view with optional rendered overlay** would be more elegant, though I understand this might be a larger architectural change.

## Impact
This simple addition would significantly improve the markdown workflow in VS Code, making it competitive with dedicated markdown editors while maintaining VS Code's strengths.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/263517,1

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Description:
VS Code does not respect the Windows mouse setting for ""Lines to scroll at a time"". Regardless of the value set in Windows (e.g., 1, 5, 25), the editor consistently scrolls by exactly 3 lines per mouse wheel notch.

Steps to Reproduce:
Set the mouse wheel scroll to a specific value (e.g., 5) in Windows Settings (Devices > Mouse).
Open a file in VS Code.
Scroll with the mouse wheel.

Expected Result:
The text should scroll by the number of lines configured in Windows system settings (e.g., 5).

Actual Result:
The text always scrolls by 3 lines per notch.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
When the bottom `panel` is minimized, it disappears completely off-screen.
- New users may assume that the `panel` has been **closed**.
- Restoring it requires **pixel-perfect mouse placement** at the bottom edge.

### Proposed Feature
When minimizing the `panel`
- Keep a thin **header strip** visible at the bottom.

### Why this helps
- Improves discoverability (`panel` never **vanishes**).
- Makes restoring easier from the `panel header`.

### Example
The current behaviour of the `panel` (look closely at the bottom):

3349305953,Feature Request: Add keyboard shortcut to switch between Extension Development Host and main VS Code window,"Currently, when developing extensions, we constantly need to switch back and forth between the main VS Code window (where we edit the extension code) and the ""Extension Development Host"" window (where the extension is running).

Problem:
- The Extension Development Host is not referenced as a target in `keybindings.json`.
- There is no built-in keyboard shortcut to jump between the two windows.
- On macOS, Cmd+` only cycles through *all* windows of VS Code, which is inefficient when having multiple projects opened.

Impact:
- Extension developers need to switch thousands of times per day.
- Relying on Cmd+Tab or macOS Mission Control slows down iteration drastically.

Feature request:
- Add a dedicated command (e.g. `workbench.action.toggleExtensionHostWindow`) that focuses the Extension Development Host if open, or cycles between the main VS Code and the Host.
- Make it available in `keybindings.json` so developers can assign their preferred shortcut.

This would massively improve extension development workflow.

<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
When using File → Open Recent → More... in Visual Studio Code, the dialog displays the full path for each recent file or workspace. On Windows, long paths make it difficult to see the actual file or folder names, especially since the dialog cannot be resized. This makes it hard to quickly identify and select the desired item, reducing the usefulness of the ""More..."" feature.

Suggested improvements:

- Allow resizing the ""More..."" dialog window.
- Optionally display the filename or folder name first, or highlight it, instead of showing the full path from the left.
- Provide a tooltip or hover-over to show the full path if it is truncated.
- Allow customizing the columns or view mode for recent items.

**Benefit**: This would make it much easier to find and open recent files or folders, especially for users working with deep or lengthy directory structures.

<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

While using the `ms-vscode.cpptools` extension, I frequently edit classes in a split-screen view, with the *.cpp file open on the left and the *.h file open on the right. If I add a function definition to my *.h file and select the ""Create definition in *.cpp file"" option, it opens the *.cpp file in a new tab in the right-hand tab group, rather than switching focus to the already open instance in the left-hand tab group.

I opened a [discussion question in the microsoft/vscode-cpptools repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/discussions/13867) asking if there was an option to change this behavior, and it was requested that I open an issue here as they say this behavior is due to the default behavior of the `window.showTextDocument` API when called with no options.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install the `ms-vscode.cpptools` extension
2. Create an `example.cpp` file
3. Create an `example.h` file
4. Dock the `example.h` file to the right of the `example.cpp` file
5. Add an `Example` class definition in the `example.h` file
6. Add a `void Testing();` method definition to the `Example` class
7. On the `Testing` method definition, select the `Create definition of 'Testing' in example.cpp` Quick Fix option

There should be an extension API to just send a notification using the Electron API.

# **Current Behavior**
In Copilot Chat, sending a new message while Copilot is still generating cancels the ongoing response. This creates friction when working on multi-step coding tasks, since users often think of additional instructions mid-run but don’t want to interrupt.

# **Problem**

* Users must either wait for Copilot to finish before adding input, or interrupt and risk breaking the flow.
* Quick follow-up ideas can be lost if the user doesn’t manually note them down.
* Long tasks (e.g., refactoring, scaffolding multiple files) become inefficient without a way to line up refinements.

# **Proposed Solution**
Introduce a **Prompt Queue** system:

* Allow users to add follow-up prompts to a queue while Copilot is still working.
* After Copilot finishes the current generation, queued prompts are processed in order.
* UI could show queued prompts in a lightweight panel or expandable area.
* Support actions like:

  * Queue instead of send (`Ctrl+Shift+Enter`)
  * Reorder or delete queued prompts
  * See a count of pending prompts

# **Optional Enhancements**

* Queue persists for the current chat session.
* “Send immediately” option still available for urgent cases.
* Mid-run comments: Copilot can occasionally check the queue for hints during long tasks without a full interruption.

# **Benefits**

* Prevents disruption of long or complex responses.
* Keeps user thoughts captured and actionable without context switching.
* Increases productivity for workflows involving sequential refinements.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

Currently, when the active editor is in the left-most editor group and I run the command ""Move Editor into Previous Group,"" nothing happens because there is no group further left.

I would like this command to instead create a new editor group on the left and move the active editor into it, pushing the existing groups to the right. This would somewhat mirror the existing behavior of ""Move Editor into Next Group,"" which creates a new group when invoked from the right-most editor group.

Stipulation:
This should only occur if there are two or more editors open in the left-most group.
If there is only a single editor in the left-most group, the command should continue to do nothing,
to avoid leaving the group empty.

Justification:
If I want to place an editor in the left-most position, I currently have to move it into
the existing left-most group and then manually shift other editors to the right.
This is tedious and interrupts workflow. Having ""Move Editor into Previous Group"" automatically
create a new left-most group (when more than one editor is present) would make arranging editors
much easier and more consistent.

~~Current code is in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/tree/roblou/classic-quail, `@claude` can be invoked as a participant, but that would not be the real UX.~~

### Required for a basically usable experience
- [x] Register a chat session provider to show a separate section in the chat sessions list
	- [x] And use the chat widget mode that locks it to the agent
- [x] Load chat sessions
	- [x] How to keep it in sync with real state?
	- [x] Read their format from `~/.claude/projects/<dir>/<guid>`?
- [x] Show tool confirmations using vscode's tool confirmations
	- ~~[ ] This is driven via an mcp tool plugged into the claude code sdk~~
	- [x] Driven via the canUseTool callback with streaming prompt
	- Needs all the polish of different tool confirmation types, eg for terminals, with the same auto-approve logic
- Track edits
	- Allow user to undo edits like usual? Or will that confuse the agent?
	- Apply our logic for allowing edits inside the workspace
	- But requiring confirmation for certain files (how to do this when the agent is editing the file?)
	- The agent editing files that are unsaved in vscode?
- [x] Hide tool picker or show the agent's tools in the tool picker

### Polish
- `/ide` context eg open files, tools to integrate with editor
  - Not sure if it should be based on us implementing the websocket protocol that CC uses https://github.com/coder/claudecode.nvim/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md or just installing the official CC extension
- Support multi-root via `additionalDirectories`
- Show background bash shells (`/bashes`)?
- `/compact`
- `/memory`
- Manage agents, show subtasks. The user's configured agents are used by the sdk
- Start and manage a claude code agent on a different directory (eg worktree)
- Support custom `/` commands
- Test all types of vscode attachments
- Enable mcp servers configured in vscode
- Fully use streaming mode to use same CC process across requests, timing out at some point
- Align Bash command approval with vscode's auto-approval as configured by the user
- Show tool invocation progress in a nicer way (currently tool calls only show up when done)

## Open questions
- Session storage- we read sessions from `~/.claude`, but the vscode requests have some of their own metadata that I don't have anywhere to store, so things like attachments on the original request can't be restored https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/264816
- Conversation summaries don't work because it looks like claude code doesn't respect the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var for these requests
- We redirect haiku requests to gpt-4o-mini but it has a much lower prompt token limit than expected, so these sometimes fail
- Branding, icons, etc
- Our Claude 4 has a much smaller context window than what Claude Code assumes. We adjust the reported token usage so that auto-compact will be triggered correctly, but it's still a bit off because after compaction, the conversation gets resized so a size that Claude Code thinks is safe, but is actually still a bit close to our context limit.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/262756,1

Please let VS Code remember which Activity Bar view container (Explorer, Search, Source Control, Extensions, or an extension-contributed view) was last active and reopen that same one when you restart VS Code.

When a merge conflict occurs, there are 2 visual ways to fix it AFAIK.\\
If i set `""editor.codeLens"": false` then one of them becomes unusable, even tho `""merge-conflict.codeLens.enabled"": true` is set.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a merge conflict scenario.
2. Set `""editor.codeLens"": false`
3. Set `""merge-conflict.codeLens.enabled"": true`
4. Merge conflict cannot be solved this way as there is no button for applying changes.

Hi, and thank you for your incredible work on VS Code - it's truly my go-to editor.

##  Feature Suggestion:
I'd love to see a built-in **""Quick Workspace Switcher""** accessible from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), similar to how we can switch Git branches or open recent files/folders.

Example command:
```
> Workspaces: Switch to...
```

It could display a list of `.code-workspace` files or known workspaces, allowing the user to quickly switch between them - ideally in the same window.

##  What exists today:
- `Ctrl + R` (Open Recent) lists folders and workspaces, but doesn't allow quick filtering by workspace name only.
- There are some community extensions like `vscode-workspace-switcher`, but this feels like a core productivity feature.
- The `File > Open Workspace` option is available but requires manual browsing.

##  Why this could help:
- Many developers juggle multiple `.code-workspace` files and need fast switching.
- Could boost workflow and session management, similar to JetBrains IDEs or browser tab switchers.
- Keeps the experience consistent within Command Palette without relying on extensions.

Thanks for considering this! I'd be happy to discuss the idea further or even contribute if this fits your vision.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/262349,1

It would be really nice to be able to search the file timeline for specific text, dates or other criteria to narrow down the files that you might be looking for.

Description

Feature Request

Currently, Visual Studio Code allows customization of terminal profiles (name, path, color, etc.), but does not support adding custom icons for each terminal. This makes it harder to visually distinguish multiple terminals when working with different environments (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker, remote SSH). And recently, with the development of AI CLI such as Gemini CLI and Claude Code, it's more important to distinguish them by terminal icon. Claude Code has already used their own icon in integrated terminal.

<img width=""205"" height=""83"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f97d27d5-98c4-4672-a313-5c16bc163d14"" />

But I found available icons are less. 
<img width=""462"" height=""266"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/530c71c2-553b-45be-a700-96a19c4e02d3"" />

Motivation
	•	Improves usability when multiple terminal profiles are open but screen space is limited.
	•	Provides a quick visual cue to identify which terminal corresponds to which runtime or task.
	•	Consistent with the customization options available for activity bar and file icons.

Proposed Solution
	•	Extend terminal profile configuration in settings.json to include an optional icon field.
	•	Support both built-in VSCode icons (Codicons) and user-provided custom icons (SVG/PNG).
	•	Display the icon alongside the terminal name in the dropdown and tab bar.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/261991,1
3327792552,Group Conversations with Git Branch Context in Copilot Chat,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

**Summary:**
Introduce the ability to create and manage grouped conversations in GitHub Copilot Chat, with the option to associate each group with a specific branch of the current repository.

**Detailed Description:**
When working on a project with multiple concurrent features, it’s common to switch between branches frequently. Each branch often represents a distinct context - like a new feature, bug fix, or refactor, and ideally, conversations with Copilot should reflect that.

This feature would allow developers to:

* **Create and name conversation groups** within Copilot Chat.
* **Associate each group with a specific Git branch** in the current VS Code workspace.
* **Automatically switch Copilot chat context** when switching between branches.
* View and resume prior conversations relevant to a branch, maintaining continuity in problem-solving and discussions.

**Use Case:**
Imagine I'm working on three different features:

* `feature/login-auth`
* `feature/payment-integration`
* `bugfix/navbar-glitch`

Each of these branches has different technical needs, issues, and ongoing conversations with Copilot. Instead of one long, cluttered history, I’d like to keep conversations grouped by their corresponding branch. That way, when I switch from `feature/login-auth` to `bugfix/navbar-glitch`, I immediately get back the relevant chat history and context - questions I asked, Copilot’s suggestions, and code snippets - all tied to that specific line of work.

**Benefits:**

* Cleaner, more organized Copilot chat experience.
* Context-aware conversations.
* Increased productivity and focus when juggling multiple branches/features.
* Easier collaboration: when teammates check out a branch, they can access the related conversation history for that branch as well (if shared).

Easily my most hated VS.Code behavior - searching across my project is a NIGHTMARE because the list is constantly resorting.  My item will show up almost immediately, but before I can even select it, it's been resorted off the page.  I honestly don't see why people rave about VS.Code so much (over VS.Net) given stuff like this - it is EXTREMELY frustrating to use.  Why would you not have a mode where you just append results to THE END OF THE LIST!??!??!?   Can you at least provide a use case to where the current behavior is actually helpful (am I supposed to click Search and then go get a coffee until it finishes?  If so, how do I know that it's done and won't resort again as I scroll the list)?  It is just so annoying and tedious this way that it feels like it was never actually tested in the real world.

Screen reader users might miss the message about confirmation required. They also might be in the editor when this comes in and moving focus to the confirmation dialog can be tedious. 

We discussed using the notifications center, but I worry only power users would go there. It would also still be tedious to navigate to the one of interest.

We discussed indicating user action required in the window title, but this is chat specific context that shouldn't be globally presented.

We landed on this new idea: have a command to announce/focus the chat confirmation dialog from anywhere.

We'd also announce there's no confirmation required when applicable.

I'd like built-in voice recognition that understands natural language programming commands. For example, saying ""create a function that validates email addresses"" would generate appropriate code, or ""go to UserService class"" would navigate to that file.

- Natural language code generation via voice commands
- Voice-controlled navigation (""go to line 50"", ""find function getUserData"")
- Code editing commands (""add error handling"", ""rename this variable to userCount"")
- Context-aware suggestions based on current file and project

**Benefits:**
- Reduced RSI from excessive typing
- Better accessibility for developers with disabilities
- Faster prototyping and brainstorming
- Hands-free coding during architectural discussions

- Make planning mode default or automatic for coding task prompts
- Make planning easier to customize, setting specific read-only tools (MCP servers, CLI commands) and plan templates (PRD, ADR, etc)
- Iterative plan mode in editor docs for heavier spec-driven development

Key scenarios the building blocks enable:

Right now, once a run starts, it’s locked to one model (Sonnet, GPT-5, Gemini, etc.). If you want to use a different one, you basically have to restart the conversation or lose context.

It would be useful if an agent could switch models *during* a run and keep going without losing state.

For example we can introduce a `tool` `switch_mode` which accepts:
- New agent mode id/ name
- context to pass
- prompt to pass

Offcourse, this also need careful planning of modes, tool should know what mdoels are configures in user environment. 

Example:

* Use **Sonnet** for planning.
* Switch to **GPT-5** for implementation.
* Switch to **Gemini** for verification/ docuemntation.

Jsut like roocode, any agent mode can call tool letys jusr say `switch_mode` to change mode. ",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/261416,1

   - tests (cc @connor4312)
   - terminal (cc @Tyriar)
   - Notebook tools (cc @DonJayamanne)
- `codebase` is just semantic search, `search` has the actual file search and read
- A few should be user-controlled `#context` entries (`searchResults`, `testFailure`, `terminalLastCommand`, …) and not agentic tools

cc @ntrogh who did the last copy cleanup, for thoughts.
cc @aeschli how might we make tool name migration easier when defined in modes/prompts, like aliasing the old names?
cc @jo-oikawa for UX input.

Hey! I previously filed an issue requesting that gpt-oss be added to Copilot Chat. Now that GPT-5 has launched, GPT-5 Mini looks especially interesting.

I’ve attached a cost/performance graph from Artificial Analysis. GPT-5 Mini appears in the graph’s preferred quadrant alongside gpt-oss-120b (high) and grok-3-mini (high).  

<img width=""4092"" height=""2052"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaecc8c9-1952-4dc5-955b-f5d6f65cf1eb"" />

Adding GPT-5 Mini to GitHub Copilot could improve the experience by delivering faster responses, reducing token and compute usage, and maintaining strong performance at a lower cost. Additionally, GPT-5 Nano, which is also shown on the graph, is even faster and cheaper. It could be a good fit for simpler or repetitive tasks where latency and cost matter most, and could potentially be offered as an ""included model"" that does not affect user limits.

Thanks for considering!

3307558643,Show command descriptions as tooltips in Command Palette,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

When using the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), only the command title is shown in the list.
If you don't already know what a command does, the only way to find out is to run it or go search for it.

I think we could improve this by showing the command’s description (if available) when you hover over it.

VS Code already stores descriptions for a lot of commands (both core and from extensions) in the `CommandsRegistry`. Right now that data isn’t surfaced in the UI, which feels like a missed opportunity.

### Why this would help
- Makes it easier to explore and understand less common commands.
- Good for new users who are still learning what’s available.
- Doesn’t require any new data — we’d just use what’s already there.

### Idea for implementation
- In the quick input list rendering (`quickInputList.ts`), grab the metadata for each command from `CommandsRegistry.getCommand(id)`.
- If it has a description, set it as the `title` attribute for that list item (browser/Electron will show this as a tooltip).
- Fallback to the command’s title if there’s no description.

**Example:**

Before:  
Hover over `Toggle Side Bar Visibility` → nothing happens.

After:  
Hover over `Toggle Side Bar Visibility` → shows “Shows or hides the sidebar in the workbench”.

If this sounds reasonable, I’m happy to try implementing it.

Title: Display token multiplier for models in manageModels view (same as model picker)

Description:
In the new manageModels interface (accessible via the model selection dropdown in the inline chat UI), it would be very helpful to display the token multiplier next to each model — similar to how it's shown in the model picker (e.g., 1x, 0.33x, etc.).

Currently, in the ""Manage Language Models"" dialog, this information is missing, making it harder to make informed decisions about model cost/performance tradeoffs.

Why it's useful:

The token multiplier is a critical factor when choosing between models, especially for users conscious of performance vs. speed vs. cost.

This would bring consistency between the model selection dropdown and the model management modal.

Feature request:

Add token multiplier display next to each model in the manageModels UI.

Format: identical to how it appears in the main dropdown (see screenshot for reference).

3302516173,Option to auto-select pasted content after pasting,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

When pasting text into the editor (e.g., a Python block or paragraph), the newly inserted content is **not automatically selected**. This makes it inconvenient when users want to quickly re-indent, reformat, or wrap the pasted block, especially if the indentation is off or if additional editing is required right after pasting.

**Suggestion:**
Add a setting such as:

```json
""editor.selectAfterPaste"": true
```

When enabled, any content that is pasted (via keyboard or mouse) would remain selected immediately after the paste operation, allowing users to:

* Quickly adjust indentation (e.g., with `Tab` or `Shift+Tab`)
* Apply formatting or run commands on just the pasted text
* Avoid manually reselecting the block that was just inserted

**Why this matters:**

* Improves workflow when dealing with multiline code snippets
* Saves time in refactoring or formatting pasted blocks
* Particularly useful in indentation-sensitive languages like Python or YAML

3302510529,"Add ""Select for Compare"" and ""Compare with Selected"" options directly in file tab context menu","
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

🔸 Description / Suggestion:

Currently, to compare two files in VS Code, users must right-click the file name in the Explorer sidebar to access ""Select for Compare"" and ""Compare with Selected"". However, when multiple files are already open in tabs, this process is unintuitive and slows down the workflow.

Suggestion:
Add the ""Select for Compare"" and ""Compare with Selected"" options to the right-click context menu of file tabs (the tab bar at the top of the editor). This would allow users to initiate comparisons directly between open files without going back to the Explorer panel.

Why this matters:

    Improves UX for users working mostly in the editor view

    Makes the compare workflow more discoverable and fluid

    Aligns with the principle of minimizing context-switching

When the activity bar is positioned at the top or bottom, keep its icons visible and allow clicking them to toggle the sidebar, matching the behavior of left/right positions.

## Current Behavior
- Left/Right activity bar:
  - Sidebar can be collapsed while activity bar icons remain visible
  - Clicking an icon opens/expands the sidebar; clicking the active icon can collapse it
- Top/Bottom activity bar:
  - Ctrl+B hides the sidebar but also hides the activity bar icons
  - Clicking icons does not toggle the sidebar

## Requested Behavior
- Keep activity bar icons visible when the sidebar is hidden, even with top/bottom activity bar
- Allow clicking activity bar icons to toggle the sidebar (open/close) and focus the selected view
- Preserve existing keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+B) to hide/show the sidebar without hiding the icons
- Maintain consistent animations and focus behavior across all positions

## Benefits
- Consistent UX across all activity bar positions
- Better space optimization while retaining quick access to views
- Improved discoverability and usability with both mouse and keyboard",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260437,1

<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
**Background**
Our extension surfaces test coverage information via the Explorer View using the built-in VS Code coverage UI. This is enabled through the `testing.showCoverageInExplorer` setting.

While this setting works well, it’s currently only accessible via the Settings UI or by manually editing settings.json. We’ve explained this to our users, but feedback is for a toggle option to turn the coverage view on and off as needed, and the lack of a quick toggle makes this workflow inconvenient.

**Problem**
For many developers, always showing coverage in the Explorer View adds visual noise or isn’t needed all the time. So they disable it, but once disabled, they may never re-enable it, simply because going into settings is too much friction. This means users miss out on a feature because it's ""set and forget"" and there's no lightweight / fluid way to turn it back on when they need it.

---

While we could extend our extension with an extra option / setting to control this behavior (e.g. where the `testing.showCoverageInExplorer` is ALWAYS enabled, but we only emit the coverage information on an as needed basis via our own mechanism), we feel such a mechanism would be useful as part of VS Code's first class Testing functionality.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260229,1

This is going to break us Sept 15th... because of these steps:
* Ask for auth with scope X -> get a token
* Use token at API -> it 401s with WWW-Authenticate saying it needs more claims
* 🐛 we have no way to pass that down to the Microsoft auth provider, we can only have it force re-creation of a token

Implementing this in a generic fashion... we could introduce a new `challenges` array to `getSession`:

```ts
const challenges = // literally the array of WWW-Authenticate header values
vscode.authentication.getSession('microsoft', scopes, { createIfNone: true, challenges }
```

And then in the auth provider we could make this a concrete object that contains some well-known properties like `claims`, `scopes`, etc:

* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html#section-3
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9470#name-authentication-requirements
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-use-of-www-authenticate-for
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2617#section-3.2.1

while also supporting any other key.

At this point the auth provider can do what it wants with that... which in Microsoft's case will pass the claims value into MSAL.

#### Alternative `getSession` API

Making the 2nd parameter more about influencing the shape of the token and less about the UI, we could do this:
```ts
const challenges = // literally the array of WWW-Authenticate header values
vscode.authentication.getSession('microsoft', { scopes, challenges }, { createIfNone: true }

## Feature Request: Support for Multiple Simultaneous Chat Sessions in GitHub Copilot for VS Code

It would be extremely useful to support **multiple named chat conversations for specialized roles** in GitHub Copilot in the side chat panel, allowing users to work sequentially but in **parallel chat histories** - just like in-editor multiple chats work. This would provide a large comfort and clarity increase, while avoiding many coordination issues and complexities of true concurrency (as proposed in [#242318](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/242318) ).

#### Why this matters:

When working with CLI-based agents like Gemini or Claude, I typically maintain **4+ active chat tabs**, each named, launched with a shortcut command, dedicated to a specific role or task—e.g., architect, developer (backend, frontend, ops), or QA. While they share access to documentation, each agent focuses only on its domain, dramatically improving task efficiency and reducing off-topic drift, as well as reducing to almost none the risk of editing the same files at the same time.

This approach mirrors how a real team works—clear ownership, focused context, and reduced cognitive load.

#### Example Workflow:

1. A new feature is requested.
2. **Architect agent** researches online, gathers documentation, and creates a high-level design and `tasks.md` .
3. **Developer agent** reads the docs, picks a task, and creates a new `task.md` with a step-by-step plan.
4. Developer progresses through `task.md` steps, tracking progress in the same task file.
5. Once complete, the **QA agent** reads the `task.md` and docs, tests the implementation, and prepares a `task-qa-report.md`
6. If issues are found:

   * For implementation bugs, the developer reviews the `task-qa-report.md`and fixes the issue.
   * For design flaws, the architect revisits the docs and `task-qa-report.md` and updates the design as needed, and adds relevant task to the `tasks.md` and to the `task.md` with necessary changes

7. This loop continues until QA passes.
8. Architect marks the top-level task as complete.
9. Developer moves on to the next task and creates another task-specific `task.md`

This modular, chat-tabbed approach is **vastly more effective** than maintaining a single monolithic conversation. It also improves **token efficiency** by scoping prompts and context to just the relevant agent, instead of loading the entire project history each time. Having tabs directly in the side panel would make navigating and previewing the work much easier.

#### Suggested Implementation:

* Add support for **multiple chat tabs** within Copilot Chat side panel in VS Code.
* Each tab should maintain its own context, configuration, and history - just like having multiple conversations in editor work.
* Users can name tabs (e.g., “Architect,” “Backend Dev,” “QA”) to reflect their role or function - this could also be added to the multi conversation in editor.
* Simplify saving roles and prompts for the roles or creating these specialized agents
* Add an UI indication which tabs have made edits last or have pending edits to keep
* This complements, rather than replaces, concurrent development workflows (e.g., using worktrees with multiple instances of VS Code running then resolving merge conflicts with an agent, or in the future handling this directly within the UI as proposed in [#242318](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/242318) )

#### Impact:

This feature would significantly increase comfort of using multiple conversations and make GitHub Copilot more suitable for **complex, full-stack projects** involving multi-agent workflows, while still allowing good preview of the edits. 
Personally, this would be a strong enough reason to switch back from CLI-based agents to Copilot within VS Code.
With this approach it would still be down to the user to ensure the agents don't edit the same files in parallel, and the current handling of file edits would suffice. GH could provide some preconfigured roles for an easier startup, I'm happy to share my prompts for that. 

#### Known Workaround:
Move the conversations to in-editor chats or in the new window.

### Problem
I installed the [VS Code Speech extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) and tried to enable Arabic speech recognition and synthesis using `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage: ""ar-EG""` in `settings.json`.

However, the extension does not accept this value and shows an error:
> Value is not accepted. Valid values: ""auto"", ""en-US"", ""fr-FR"", ... (list of currently supported languages)

This is unexpected because Arabic is fully supported by Azure Speech SDK (on which the extension is based), including `ar-EG`, `ar-SA`, and `ar-AE`.

### Expected behavior
Arabic should be available in the list of supported `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage` values, or at least accepted when manually entered in `settings.json`.

### Why it's important
Arabic is spoken by hundreds of millions worldwide. Having support in VS Code Speech would significantly improve accessibility and usability for Arabic-speaking developers.

### System Info
- **VS Code Version**: [add your version here]
- **OS**: [Windows/macOS/Linux]

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Install VS Code Speech extension

Current Issue:
GitHub Copilot currently saves chat history, but users are unable to see when each question was asked or when responses were given. This lack of visible timestamps makes it challenging to track the timing of conversations and to reference the exact time of edits when problems occur.

Suggested Improvement:
Incorporate visible timestamps for both user questions and Copilot responses within the chat history interface. Each message should display the date and time it was sent or received.

Advantages:
Makes it easier for users to review and navigate past conversations
Provides clearer context for the sequence and flow of discussions
Allows users to reference specific messages by their time of occurrence
Supports improved debugging and productivity analysis

Acceptance Criteria:
Timestamps are shown for every message in the chat history
Both date and time are displayed in a clear, user-friendly manner

## 🧩 Feature Request: Make `${workspaceFolder}` resolve to the `.code-workspace` file location in multi-root workspaces

### 📝 Summary

In multi-root workspaces, when defining tasks directly in the `.code-workspace` file, `${workspaceFolder}` currently resolves to the **first folder listed** in `""folders""`. This behavior is unintuitive and error-prone. I propose that `${workspaceFolder}` should instead resolve to the **folder containing the `.code-workspace` file itself**, which is a clear and unambiguous context.

---

### 🔍 Current Behavior

- `${workspaceFolder}` resolves to the first folder in `""folders""` array.
- This can lead to incorrect path resolutions when tasks are defined in the `.code-workspace` file.
- Users must work around this by using `${workspaceFolder:folderName}`, which adds verbosity and complexity.

---

### ✅ Proposed Behavior

- When used inside the `.code-workspace` file, `${workspaceFolder}` should resolve to the folder containing that file.
- This would make task paths and other configurations more predictable and ergonomic.

---

### 💡 Benefits

- Eliminates ambiguity in multi-root setups.
- Aligns with user expectations—tasks defined in the workspace file should belong to the workspace.
- Reduces need for scoped variable workarounds.
- Improves maintainability and clarity of workspace-level configurations.

---

### 🧪 Example

```json
{
  ""folders"": [
    { ""path"": ""project-a"" },
    { ""path"": ""project-b"" }
  ],
  ""tasks"": {
    ""version"": ""2.0.0"",
    ""tasks"": [
      {
        ""label"": ""build"",
        ""command"": ""${workspaceFolder}/scripts/build.sh""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Expected resolution: ${workspaceFolder} → folder containing .code-workspace Current resolution: ${workspaceFolder} → project-a

## Description

VS Code has `chat.notifyWindowOnConfirmation` for when Copilot Chat needs user confirmation, but no equivalent for when agent mode finishes executing multi-step tasks. Agent mode is most valuable when users are able to be productive in other ways while it is executing. However, value is lost if users must manually keep checking for execution completion during long-running agent sessions.

## Proposed Solution

Add a setting called `chat.notifyWindowOnCompletion` (boolean, default `false`) (similar to `chat.notifyWindowOnConfirmation`) to show OS notifications when agent/edit mode execution finishes.

## Expected Behavior

-  Desktop notification when agent/edit mode completes (successfully or with errors)
-  The notification should include a basic status (""Copilot completed"" or ""Copilot finished with errors"")
-  Clicking the notification brings VS Code to the foreground with focus in the chat window

## Use Case

Long-running agent sessions, e.g. with tool usage and multi-file changes.

<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
In certain cases it's disruptive that array settings are not merged, e.g. a workspace-specific config may be needed which disables all prior configuration, which is a) not transparent to the user that may have opened a third-party project, and b) cannot easily be circumvented short of putting all your user configuration into all workspace-specific files.

Example:
User Config:
```
""clangd.arguments"": [
    ""--header-insertion=never""
]
```
This is the only way to make clangd not automatically insert headers (that are often not relevant).
This should, in my opinion, stay in the user config.

I have multiple workspaces that share a folder among them. To make clangd work (using the workspace-specific compile-commands.json even for files in the shared folder) I need this in all workspace settings:
```
""clangd.arguments"": [
	""--compile-commands-dir=${workspaceFolder}/../project_1/build""
]
```

Currently, any user opening these projects will find their own preferences broken.
To fix them, they need to manually copy their user preferences into ALL workspace settings (4 in my case).
In addition, with a project using git, having to keep local changes is a nightmare, since the workspace settings should NOT be listed in the .gitignore.
Really, there is no good solution to this as long as vscode just overwrites the user settings and doesn't merge the arrays.

I recognise that there is no perfect way to do this, especially since changing the default now might break existing setups.
Unless we're doing non-standard stuff like:
```
""clangd.arguments.add"": [
    ""--header-insertion=never""
]
```
which, when overriding or being overridden, marks the array for merging. Perhaps a different syntax is required.

When you run the command `File: Compare Active File with Clipboard` the clipboard is in the left pane of the diff editor, making it more like the reverse `File: Compare Clipboard with Active File` in my opinion. The solution would be to plainly change the order and either add another function that does the reverse (currently implemented) order, or add a settings entry where you choose the default behavior.

<img width=""516"" height=""160"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5a61c7a-aa86-45d5-af44-e90c513d8425"" />

A secondary request would also be to make sure the swap sides button is available for this function (it's not present for clipboard comparison), but that seems to be because of the hacky way the `clipboardCompare{int}` scheme is implemented, and thus I think that could be considered a bug rather than a feature request.

I find myself using this function a lot these days when getting code written by external tools such as Gemini Canvas, and want to quickly see what the actual changes are for each iteration. I've seen this request brought up elsewhere before, with the solution being offered is using the swapdiff extension by shalimski, but that is still a bit buggy (opens a new editor when swapping) and requires an extra step.

I haven't contributed here before so I'm not aware how things work around here, but I could take this upon myself if needed and just implement the first solution, which would be good enough for my current requirements. I don't know how fast things move around here though, some quick insight would be appreciated.

It appears there is no way for extensions to invoke this routing via the VS Code plugin API:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/3eaa65007ec41a0426295bea00914814bd5c0650/src/vs/platform/mcp/common/mcpManagementService.ts#L235

I am working on the Copilot Chat extension and have NuGet packages which contain an embedded `.mcp/server.json` file. I would like to map this to VS Code MCP JSON using the `toScannedMcpServerAndInputs` method.

That way, it can be flowed through the assisted installation flow.

I propose a new `enabledApiProposals` is added that exposes this mapping behavior.

Alternatively, the contract of `github.copilot.chat.mcp.setup.flow` could be changed to allow `server.json` format to be returned while still supporting VS Code's JSON format also -- perhaps with an enum to differentiate, thus allowing VS Code internally to do the mapping.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
Hi, I would like the ability to track how much code was generated by an Human VS how much code was generated by AI (Copilot, Cline etc).

My current idea is to create a new extension and listen to vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument and just track the changes there. But the event today does not report if another extension is generating that code or if it's a human. If we could just have a property flagging if the event was trigged by another extension that probably would be enough. 

So my ask here is, would be possible to add some way for developers of extensions to identify if the code being added in the editor is being made by an AI extension or by an human?

The next challenge will be how to expose and consume it, but we can do it more easily just saving to a temp file and reading/cleaning it after commits. ",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259077,1
3281077657,Search String Only in Files Changed (Uncommitted) via Git,"**Problem:**
Currently in VS Code, there is no built-in way to search for a string only within files that are modified but not yet committed (i.e., tracked by Git but with changes in the working tree or index).

**Workaround:**
A common workaround involves using the terminal:

_git diff --name-only_

Then copying that list into the “files to include” field in VS Code's search panel. However, this is manual, error-prone, and repetitive.

Proposed Feature:
Add a built-in filter/scope option in the Global Search panel:

🔍 Search only in files with uncommitted Git changes

This filter would automatically:

Detect files listed by git diff --name-only.

Limit the search scope to these files.

- Speeds up debugging and code review workflows.
- Helps in focused refactoring.
- Makes Git integration in VS Code even more powerful.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259037,1

When I clone and open a repository in VS Code for the first time and the repo has a devcontainer config, VS Code suggests to open the repo in the dev container. I almost always choose this option as I really like dev containers
Once VS Code has built the dev container, the right bottom part of the window opens a terminal which is also great
Only thing is that this terminal view is split and to the left of it, there is the ports view for the forwarded ports. I usually don't need this an it steals a lot of space from the terminal. I want to be able to specify what views are open by default on a new devcontainer and how much space they can occupy and where.

Ideally this should be in the user settings and be applied to all dev containers

Context at https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/61213.

Say you have these functions:

```dart
void foo() {
  foo();
}


void bar() {
  foo();
}
```

This is the current UI for `Show Call Hierarchy`:

<img width=""210"" height=""81"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b8f2f38-0443-41d1-84dc-c8bd0335c76d"" />

This can make the visualisation really confusing, and I'd like to request that you add an icon or something to identify the function calls itself rather than making it open for ever in this tree.

When setting the `Activity Bar` to be aligned at the top of the window (via `View → Appearance → Activity Bar Position → Top`), the icons remain left-aligned. There is currently no setting or CSS override that allows centering these icons.

This would be especially helpful for minimal themes and centered layouts. Ideal behavior would be:

- A setting like `""activityBar.iconAlignment"": ""center""` (default: `""start""`)
- Or auto-centering when the bar is horizontally oriented

Description:
In the current interface design, the options bar automatically closes every time an option is checked. If you want to check more than one option, you need to open the option bar repeatedly. I would like to be able to check multiple options at once without closing the option bar, i.e., the option bar does not disappear after selecting the checkbox.

I suggest adding a copy icon at the bottom of the Copilot response section, so that users can directly copy the content of the Copilot response by clicking it. Please refer to the image below for details.

Although it is currently possible to right-click in the Copilot response area to choose the copy option, I think this approach is not very intuitive and is inconvenient to use. Moreover, copying is a very frequent operation, and most AI products or editors provide a copy button directly at the bottom of the response area.

Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

Thank you very much for putting this Feature request form In easy to get place because I totally support Microsoft and I wanna see you guys do as good as possible not that you aren't already but basically there there's a plug in that you can get for Visual Studio Code called Paste by Select and basically It will select the code automatically for you after you paste it as  when you're pasting code you always gotta indent it don't you?..  So this feature request is a feature request that you add a feature like that right under The paste button in Visual Studio Code so people could automatically paste code and have it selected. I sent a feature request to the maker of The paste by select plugin that they should put 
A button to invoke their Paste by select feature on the Visual Studio Code right click menu and also put a flyout menu that would allow you to paste selected and auto indent one tab or two tabs or three tabs you know three extra items in a flyout menu right under that and if you add that to visual studio code that would totally optimize the performance for basically all your users... Thanks for the latest update to Windows 11 it's absolutely beautiful... One more note as far as efficiency See you have a button that says preview on Github but then when I click that because it's the only option I gotta sign into Github and I'm really busy you see and that's a little bit of a hindrance because then I gotta go get up and get my phone and find my authenticator app on the phone and get the number and type it in I would just have a button where you could well I would have two buttons you could either preview it on Github or send it I guess to get hub directly with no other steps involved... I'm a genius at logic ... And the easier that you make this you know the more often I could send cool upgrade ideas because I do fully support microsoft... And just to note not everybody has it easily set up to sign in to do feature requests on Windows 11 and before you didn't make it so you had to sign in and it was easy to send feature requests but now that you have to sign in see I have a lot of feature requests for you for Windows eleven that are on the backlog that I can't send because i'm building a corporation and uh I don't really have extra time to waste so if you could put that back to feature request just always working w/o login that would be way more awesome I can send you cool ideas all the time.

Related Issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/257856 (bug preventing access to old chat histories, which gets fixed by doing chat imports).

Currently, the ""Import Chat"" command restricts you to importing a single .json file at a time. This suggestion is to add the ability to import multiple .json files at once, with each file being a separate chat conversation, as to minimize hassle of bulk imports.

This would be an extremely beneficial addition for the purpose of chat backups from a workspaceStorage session, or if a user wants to port over conversations from one workspace into another.

This would also help immensely for instances where a workspaceStorage session becomes inaccessible due to workspace renaming, modifications, saving, etc., losing access to that session's chat histories.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/258566,1

Developers are used to tools which auto-format their code for them (Prettier, format on save, etc). When working with Next Edit Suggestions, the suggestion frequently is to simply format the recently modified code. This is distracting and slows down development, as it takes time to process what the suggestion is. It does not matter whether I accept or ignore the suggestion, as the code will be formatted automatically by other tools, and so it wastes time and slows down actual development.

I'd like to suggest a setting to disable formatting-only modifications from Next Edit Suggestions. Alternatively, we could use custom instructions specifically for Next Edit Suggestions to request no formatting-only modifications.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/258482,1

In cases like having two main files in folders like
```
projects/very_long_folder_name/main.c
projects/other_very_long_folder_name/main.c
```
There should be a way to truncate the directory name in the `workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns` settings:
```
**/*.c : ${filename} - ${dirname}.slice(0, 4)...
```
So that the name of the files do not take up the entire space of the tab, but so that it is still possible to differentiate them. This also suggests adding other string manipulation macros.

Another macro that displays the directory name (or anything else) only when it is needed for having unique names in the tab, like the default `workbench.editor.labelFormat` does, would be helpful.

Merging `editor.customLabels` and `editor.label` would perhaps be best, so that the default/short/medium/long label displays would be defined by custom labels, as the default label formats of VScode.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/258423,1

Short cut to close tabs while picker is still open. 

Description:
Right now the workflow is open picker ""crtl + tab"" select tab pushing enter, which closes the picker, than close the tab with ""crtl + w"". If you want to close other tabs that way you have to open the tab picker again.
I know there is a close button that appears when hovering over a tab in quick selection. However there is no way to assign a shortcut to that close button which breaks the flow in my opinion when you have to move to the mouse just to hit that close button for a feature that you can only use with a shortcut to begin with.

Sometimes I've worked with Copilot on some code and I feel like it works really well and the active copilot chat contains knowledge useful for tackling lots of tasks.  It would be great if I could duplicate the chat at this point such that I can continue working with copilot in the active chat session and later on work with the forked chat, that doesn't contain all the newer messages afterwards.  I would then afterwards have that same nice state as basis for tackling another task.

When running commands in the terminal, users are sometimes prompted to answer with Y/N — but currently, this prompt isn’t announced. This can create a poor experience for screen reader users, and it can also disrupt workflows for anyone who’s multitasking or not watching the terminal closely.

We already `have terminal.integrated.autoReplies`, which is helpful, but I’d propose one of two enhancements:

Option A: Introduce a dedicated setting to detect and auto-respond to standard Y/N prompts when running in Copilot terminal agent mode.

Option B: At a minimum, ensure that these prompts are audibly announced for screen reader users.

This would help streamline agent workflows and improve accessibility and usability across the board.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/258252,1

However, it can be frustrating when I spend a long time viewing a preview tab (which often indicates I want to keep it) and then it gets replaced as soon as I open another file.

- VS Code Version: 
- OS Version: 

Steps to Reproduce:

I'm using shadcn and tailwind, and their method of setting up themes is defining tailwind variables in tailwind.config.js like so:

`lighter: 'hsl(var(--color-primary-lighter))'`

And then in the globals.css file, you put non-comma values with *no* hsl(), like:
    --primary: 0 0% 9%;

The issue with this, is that the vscode color picker won't pick this up. And if you switch this around to have hsl and commas in the globals.css file, and no hsl() in the tailwind config file, then it breaks tailwind's `/50` opacity syntax, like `bg-lighter/50`.

Really frustrating, and as far as i can tell, this isn't going to change on their end. So I'm hoping VSCode's color picker can be updated to detect this properly.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/257891,1

### Current behavior:

Currently, VSCode prevents 
1. creating a new Profile that inherits all of these elements from the Default Profile: Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Tasks, Snippets, and Extensions
2. editing existing Profile to make it inherit all of these elements

While it might seem unnecessary to create such a profile, even if a Profile inherits all these elements from the Default Profile, it still has its own global storage and its own UI configuration. Therefore, it still makes sense to allow creating such profiles for state isolation without configuration divergence.

Allow creating profiles that inherit all elements (Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, Tasks, Snippets, and Extensions) from the Default Profile.

### Additional Info

Relevant code snippet:
<https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c306e94f98122556ca081f527b466015e1bc37b0/src/vs/workbench/contrib/userDataProfile/browser/userDataProfilesEditorModel.ts#L239-L244>

I also tried to bypass the UI validation and enable all these elements directly in `User/globalStorage/storage.json`:
```
    ""userDataProfiles"": [
        {
            ""location"": ""1d5e814a"",
            ""name"": ""Untitled 1"",
            ""useDefaultFlags"": {
                ""settings"": true,
                ""keybindings"": true,
                ""extensions"": true,
                ""tasks"": true,
                ""mcp"": true,
                ""snippets"": true
            }
        }
```

After that, VSCode launched successfully and it seems all elements inherited correctly.

3263690112,Feature Request: Enhanced One-Click Install Support for Toolsets and Extension Bundles,"## Summary

We are requesting enhanced one-click install support for toolsets and extension bundles in VS Code to improve developer productivity and streamline the setup of comprehensive development environments.

## Background

Our project, the **Prompt Boost** (https://www.promptboost.dev), is a curated platform hosting high-quality extensions including prompts, instructions, chat modes, and MCP servers. We have integrated the amazing one-click installation system using `vscode:` URI schemes, but we've identified opportunities for VS Code to provide enhanced native support for toolset bundles.

## Current Implementation

Our platform currently supports individual extension installation through:
- `vscode://...` URIs
- Custom category-specific installation URLs for prompts, instructions, chat modes, and MCP servers
- Intelligent target switching between VS Code stable and insiders versions
- Comprehensive install button components with dropdown options

## Feature Request

We request VS Code to enhance its one-click install capabilities to support:

### 1. **Toolset Installation**
- Native support for installing toolsets, like there is for prompts, instructions etc...

### 2. **Bundle Installation**
- Native support for installing multiple related extensions as a cohesive package
- Ability to define dependencies and installation order within bundles
- Atomic installation (all-or-nothing) to prevent partial installations
- UI to review the bundle, like for MCP, maybe even collocate gallery views for extensions in the package

## Use Cases

1. **Developer Onboarding**: New team members can install a complete development package with one click
2. **Project Setup**: Quickly configure VS Code with project-specific extensions and settings, like the `extensions.json` that opens a prompt when u open vscode for the first time
3. **Environment Standardization**: Ensure consistent tooling across development teams
4. **Extension Discovery**: Improve discoverability of complementary extensions


## Benefits

- **Improved Developer Experience**: Streamlined setup process for complex development environments
- **Enhanced Extension Ecosystem**: Better support for extension creators building complementary tools
- **Reduced Friction**: Fewer manual steps required for comprehensive VS Code setup
- **Platform Growth**: Enables more sophisticated extension registries and toolset distributions

## Current Limitations

While our current implementation works well for individual extensions, we face limitations in:
- Installing multiple related extensions atomically
- Providing consistent configuration across extension bundles
- Offering optimal user experience for complex toolset installations
- Handling dependencies between different types of extensions (especially MCP servers with specific configuration requirements)

## Community Impact

This enhancement would benefit:
- Extension registry platforms like ours
- Enterprise development teams requiring standardized tooling
- Open source projects providing comprehensive development setups
- Individual developers seeking streamlined environment configuration

We believe this feature would significantly enhance the VS Code ecosystem by enabling more sophisticated and user-friendly extension distribution mechanisms.

## Reference Implementation

Our current system demonstrates the demand and feasibility of enhanced installation capabilities. You can explore our implementation at:
- Platform: https://www.promptbboost.dev
- GitHub: https://github.com/orenme/promptboost (private, but access can be given)
- Install System: See `src/components/InstallButton.tsx` and `src/utils/installUrl.ts`

3261383550,Support Built-in VSCode Commands in `tasks.json`,"## ❓ Problem Description
I tried to execute a built-in VSCode command from `tasks.json`, but the following configuration does **not** work:

```json
{
  ""label"": ""Format"",
  ""type"": ""vscode"",
  ""command"": ""editor.action.formatDocument""
}
```

Currently, VS Code does not support `""type"": ""vscode""` or directly executing built-in commands from tasks.

---

## 💡 Expected Behavior
I hope VSCode will support executing built-in commands directly in `tasks.json`. For example:

```json
{
  ""label"": ""Save and Format"",
  ""type"": ""vscode"",
  ""command"": ""workbench.action.files.saveAll""
}
```

Ideally, this should also allow using `dependsOn` to chain multiple commands together to automate common workflows.

---

## 🔄 Workarounds
- Use extensions such as [`vscode-command-runner`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=edonet.vscode-command-runner)
- Create a custom extension and use `vscode.commands.executeCommand(...)`

These solutions work but are overkill for simple use cases.

---

## 🌈 Use Cases
- Automatically save all files before build
- Automatically format code after a script runs
- Close all editors before running tests
- Reload the window or restart services as part of a task sequence

---

## 🙏 Request
- Please consider supporting built-in commands directly within `tasks.json`
- Or enhance `""type"": ""command""` to allow invoking internal VSCode commands from the task system

3261122749,feature requests to make chat confirmation required prompts more explicitly visible to screen reader users,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

## Context
When Copilot needs to perform an action such as executing a command on the terminal, it asks the user to confirm (approve) the action. The Chat confirmation required signal plays and the screen reader announces the command that a user needs to run, along with the announcement to press control+enter to accept and alt+backspace to reject (exact wording may be different).

While this is great, a user could likely miss that they need to approve an action if they are not paying very close attention to the IDE (e.g. if they are multitasking). Additionally, screen reader users who may be new to this feature do not seem to have a way to re-visit the keyboard shortcut to accept and reject actions if they miss the announcement.

## Feature Suggestions
I am making the following feature suggestions in an attempt to increase the usability of chat confirmations:
1. Provide more explicit wording in the chat confirmation view to indicate that the agent is waiting on user input. The current messaging seems to indicate a runn command:, followed by the command, and a brief description for the command. While I have not explicitly checked, I am anticipating the messaging to be similar for tool execution requests.
2. provide the buttons to accept and reject actions in the toolbar for the accessible view. This would align information sources and user flows with suggestions in the accessible view, where the buttons to accept and reject along with the keyboard shortcuts are surfaced.
3. provide an indicator in the title bar, similar to the ""circle bullet"" for edited files, indicating that the editor is waiting on a user action. This could help users quickly realize that they need to approve for the agent to proceed. This could especially be useful if users are multi-tasking. A similar messaging could also be appended to the label of the chat input box so that the user hears it when they switch focus to it.
4. have the agent respond asking the user to respond to the user action required prompt if they ask it to perform additional tasks. This is if the user misses the audio cues, forgets to check the accessible view, and misses the indicator proposed in item 3. I intentionally ignored a chat confirmation required prompt to see what happens and the agent seems to just be playing the progress sound without giving the user any indication of what it is doing. There may be other design considerations to keep in mind for this suggestion but I hope the team will take this into consideration.

## Problem
VSCode for Education today uses the view container to host a tree view that is used for navigation by the user through the course. 
<img width=""1124"" height=""1065"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bdfb44f-1de8-4666-8d88-68814ab1a085"" />

**According to accessibility guidelines, we need to provide a `nav` role to the container containing the TreeView**

As a result, the lack of navigation landmarks hinders users who rely on screen readers from understanding the page structure and efficiently navigating the interface.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Visit [https://vscodeedu.com/](https://vscodeedu.com/).
  2. Sign in with a Microsoft account.
  3. Navigate to the ""Courses"" tab, select a course, and select ""Start.""
  4. Enable the Landmarks toggle in Accessibility Insights for Web.
  5. Observe that a Navigation landmark is missing from the TreeView area.

3252589102,Feature Request: Persist Chat History with Project for Portability,"# Feature Request: Persist Chat History with Project for Portability

## Problem
Currently, chat history in Copilot Chat (and similar chat-based extensions) is not tied to the project folder. This means that if a user opens the same project on a different machine, or moves the project folder, the chat history does not follow the project. This limits the usefulness of chat as a project-specific assistant, especially for collaborative or multi-device workflows.

## Proposed Solution
- **Persist chat history locally in the project folder.**
- When a user opens a project, the chat history for that project should be loaded automatically.
- If the project is moved or opened on another machine (e.g., Codespace), the chat history should be available as long as the history file(s) are present in the project.
- The storage location could be a hidden folder (e.g., `.vscode/chat-history/` or `.copilot-chat/`) within the project root.
- Optionally, provide settings to opt-in/out, clear, or manage project chat history.

## Steps to Reproduce (Current Behavior)
1. Open a project in VS Code and use Copilot Chat.
2. Close VS Code and move the project folder to another machine, or open it in a Codespace.
3. Observe that chat history is not available for the project.

## Expected Behavior
- Chat history should be available and follow the project, regardless of where it is opened, as long as the history file is present in the project folder.

## Actual Behavior
- Chat history is not portable and does not follow the project.

## Rationale
- Improves continuity and context for project-based work.
- Enables collaborative and multi-device workflows.
- Reduces the need to re-explain project context to the chat assistant.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/257260,1

### Title

**Project-aware Context Switching in Multi-root Workspaces (Pinned Tabs, Terminal, Settings)**

### Description

#### 🚩 Problem

In a multi-root workspace, all folders are treated as peers within a single global context. As a result:

* Pinned tabs are shared globally across all folders
* Terminals are global, not project-scoped
* `settings.json` is either per-folder (manually scoped) or global
* Workspace-specific configurations like debugging, extensions, or active files are not automatically scoped to the project you’re currently working on

This becomes very limiting when working across multiple active projects (e.g., `pro-a`, `pro-b`, `pro-c`) that have different development contexts. Users often want to switch between projects *within the same workspace* but retain *per-project context*, similar to what JetBrains IDEs provide under ""Projects.""

#### ✅ Desired Behavior

When working in a multi-root workspace, selecting a folder (or any file within it) in the Explorer should automatically trigger project-level context switching, including:

* 🧷 **Pinned tabs** specific to that project
* 💻 **Dedicated terminals** (per project, restored independently)
* ⚙️ **Project-specific configurations** (settings, launch.json, tasks.json)
* 🧩 **Extension activation contexts** (optional, via `activationEvents`)
* 🗂 **Recent files**, open editors, view layout specific to the active folder

#### 💡 Implementation Ideas

* Introduce the notion of an **""active project root""** within a multi-root workspace (e.g., defined by selection or editor context)
* Allow `multiRootWorkspace.experimental.projectContexts` or similar config to opt into this behavior
* VS Code could internally switch context “views” for each root folder (think “sub-workspaces” within a workspace)

#### 🙌 Benefits

* Dramatically improves UX when working in monorepos, microservice setups, or workspace aggregations
* Allows each project to feel isolated and organized without the cost of opening multiple VS Code windows
* Empowers users to pin files, run tasks, and open terminals **without cross-project interference**

<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

When `minimap.autohide` is `""mouseover""` ([formerly](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/253868/) `true`), it makes it impossible to click on text that is behind the Minimap. It would be nice if the Esc key could be used to dismiss the Minimap. This is analogous to how the Esc key dismisses toast-style notifications. 

By default, middle-clicking in the Minimap either \\[Windows\\] does nothing or \\[Linux\\] pastes text at the current *text* cursor location (*confusing!*). Instead, middle-click could be assigned to dismiss the Minimap just like the Esc key, by rough analogy with how it can be used to close tabs.

Since it's likely the user is hiding the Minimap so that they place the text cursor or select text, you wouldn't want a small mouse jitter to cause it to reappear. I think in order for it to reappear it should require a bigger gesture. Maybe one or more of these suggestions:
* mouse leaves and re-enters the Minimap mouseover region
* mouse travels vertically by more than *n* line height(s) with no mouse button pressed
* mouse vertical scroll wheel events inside the Minimap mouseover region

3246142722,"Enable ""Reveal if open"" by default","When using multiple tabs, when a file is already open in one tab, and if the opposite tab currently has focus, if I select an already-open file in the file explorer, VS Code will open a second view of the already-open file in the focused tab.

This is extremely confusing and very poor UX - users move the cursor from tab to tab intuitively, sporadically, to edit the content they see in the other tab. The behavior of opening new files shouldn't be affected by this by default.

I've been using IDEs for 20-something years, and I always assumed this was just a bug.

As a frontend developer with some UX engineering experience, I don't believe most users are immediately and intuitively going to understand what the logic behind this behavior is.

I only just realized (after a lot of searching) that you can change this.

Long story short: please consider changing this to be the default.

Not for me, but for any new users onboarding this otherwise great and very sensible IDE. 🙂

I don't believe I've ever used another IDE that has this type of confusing behavior by default.

Split views are easily achieved by simply clicking the very prominent ""split editor"" buttons on the tab headers.

Wanting two views of the same file is nowhere near as common as wanting to switch to the file you already have open, so this makes no sense as a default.

### 💡 Feature Request

It would be highly useful to allow users to authenticate and manage **multiple GitHub accounts** (e.g., personal and work accounts) in VS Code and easily **switch between them** for:

- Git operations (push, pull, clone)
- GitHub authentication (for GitHub Pull Requests extension, Codespaces, etc.)
- GitHub Copilot or Copilot Chat

Many developers use different accounts for different organizations. Currently, switching requires manually logging out and re-authenticating, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

---

###  🔧 Proposed Feature

**Add built-in support to:**

- Store and manage multiple GitHub credentials within VS Code
- Provide a **Quick Switch** interface (similar to the existing ""Accounts"" menu)
- Allow **workspace-level** or **repo-level account selection**
- Sync selected account across extensions like Copilot, PRs, Codespaces, etc.

---

### ✅ Benefits

- Saves time and improves workflow for developers with multiple GitHub identities
- Prevents Git author config conflicts
- Enhances experience for freelancers, enterprise devs, and open-source contributors
- Reduces need for manual logins or terminal-level Git account juggling

This will only work if the welcome chat sessions nicely show previous sessions, so users can easily go back if they so decide https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251187

3237699882,"Issue: [Feature Request] Add ""Export Chat History"" Functionality","## Problem Statement
Currently, all Copilot Chat conversations are ephemeral—users lose valuable context when:
- Restarting VS Code
- Switching workspaces
- System crashes occur

This is problematic for:
- ✅ Debugging – Can’t reference past AI suggestions
- ✅ Learning – Losing explanations of complex code
- ✅ Collaboration – No way to share chat threads with teammates

## Proposed Solution
Add an ""Export Chat"" button in the chat panel that saves conversations to disk in a readable format.

### UI/UX Flow
**Button Placement:**
- Location: Next to ""Clear Chat"" (or in chat panel header)
- Icon: ⬇️ or 📁 (consistent with VS Code’s export metaphors)
- Tooltip: ""Export full chat history""

**Export Behavior:**
- File Format: .md (Markdown) for rich formatting + code blocks
- Default Filename: copilot_chat_{timestamp}.md
- Save Location: Open VS Code’s native file dialog (vscode.window.showSaveDialog)

## Technical Implementation
```json
// 1. Register command in package.json
""contributes"": {
  ""commands"": [{
    ""command"": ""copilot-chat.exportHistory"",
    ""title"": ""Export Chat History""
  }]
}
```
```typescript
// 2. Core export logic
const exportChat = async () => {
  const messages = getChatHistory(); // Array of {role, content, timestamp}
  const markdownContent = messages.map(msg => 
    `**${msg.timestamp} [${msg.role}]**\\n${msg.content}`
  ).join('\\n\\n---\\n\\n');

  const uri = await vscode.window.showSaveDialog({
    filters: { 'Markdown': ['md'] },
    defaultUri: vscode.Uri.file(`copilot_chat_${Date.now()}.md`)
  });
  
  if (uri) {
    await vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile(
      uri,

3234217269,Feature Request: Mechanism for extensions to augment the variables available for snippets with contextually-relevant information,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

The C# extension provides a suite of language-specific snippets that leverage the core Snippets functionality provided by Visual Studio Code. But, there is no contextual information specific to the language support that the C# extension provides being made available for use by snippets. I am writing this under the assumption that the reason for that is that there _isn't_ an integration point for this.

To illustrate the problem: In the C# language, one declares types, and the most common varieties of types have a feature called a constructor. The expression of this in the language repeats the type's name:
```
public class MyClass
{
  public MyClass() // <-- the constructor
  {
    ...
  }
}
```

To simplify writing this, the C# extension adds a snippet called `ctor` that autogenerates this. If you have a file called `MyClass.cs`, and it has the following text in it:
```
public class MyClass
{

}
```
...then if you position the cursor inside the class body and type `ctor` followed by the Tab key, it will insert a blank constructor automatically. However, this only works _because the filename is `MyClass.cs`_. If the filename is `Test.cs`, then it will generate an incorrect constructor:
```
public class MyClass
{
  public Test() // <-- mismatched name, this will not compile
  {

  }
}
```
The reason for this is simple: The only thing the Snippets system has at its disposable for the C# extension to use is a variable `$TM_FILENAME_BASE`. This ""sort of"" works, because much of the time, people will in fact be placing classes into files by the same name. However, the language certainly does not require this, and there are cases where more than one class is in the same file. One common instance of this is the use of _nested classes_:
```
public class ContainerClass
{
  public class NestedClass
  {

  }
}
```
The use of the `ctor` snippet in a file `ContainerClass.cs` will populate this as follows:
```
public class ContainerClass
{
  public class NestedClass
  {
    public ContainerClass() // <-- incorrect name, will not compile
    {

    }
  }
}
```

In order to resolve this issue, additional functionality needs to be available to the Snippets system. I would like to request a mechanism for the Snippets system to invite extensions to add contextual information, so that at the point where the user hits Tab to expand e.g. `ctor`, the extension is given the opportunity to analyze the file and provide additional variables. In the case of the C# extension, it could inspect the file to determine the name of the directly-enclosing type containing the caret, and add a variable e.g. `$CS_ENCLOSING_TYPE_NAME` whose value would be e.g. `NestedClass`.

This functionality could then be leveraged by a change in the extension to ultimately resolve the problem of `ctor` producing incorrect code under some circumstances. I suspect that there may be other snippets and other extensions that this would benefit as well.

Feature Request: Automatically close all tabs/editors when switching folders or workspaces

It would be very helpful if VS Code could automatically close all open tabs/editors when opening a new folder or workspace. Currently, all tabs from the previous project remain open, which quickly becomes confusing and cluttered.

Benefits:
- Better overview when switching between projects
- No more old or irrelevant files left open
- Improved workflow, especially for users who frequently switch folders/workspaces

Request:
An option in the settings or an event that extensions can use to close all tabs/editors when switching folders or workspaces.

I think it's crazy that I can not make my extension react to the currenttly open sidebar tab. 

In the most simple use case I would like to reveal the currently open file in the explorer with `revealInExplorer`, but only if the explorer is open, so that I do not constantly open the explorer pane on file switch if i was actually chatting with e.g. Copilot at the moment.

But guess what, there is absolutely NO way to check if the explorer is currently opened. How can that be, that's such a simple and sensible thing to be able to check for.

Copilot in agent mode tends to declare a script it ran hangs if it takes more than 1-2 seconds to finish.

<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

To ensure consistent behavior between local VS Code AI features and GitHub Coding Agent, the same instruction file discovery and pattern matching system used in VS Code needs to be supported by the GitHub Coding Agent.

VS Code's instruction file discovery system works as follows:

- File discovery
  - Default location: instructions folder (`**/.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`)
  - Copilot instructions: `**/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - Configurable locations: Users can configure additional locations via `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` setting
- Pattern Matching
  - Each instruction file can have frontmatter with an applyTo field that defines glob patterns `applyTo: ""**/*.ts""`

The first step toward alignment would be for the GitHub Coding Agent to adopt the same file discovery mechanism, and include a list of all discovered instruction files directly in the prompt (and potentially key metadata such as applyTo values, https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e9df78f747311117bbe0678feefdd278e0f21ff7/src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/common/promptSyntax/computeAutomaticInstructions.ts#L223-L231). This allows the model to understand what files are available and which ones it should consider when generating responses.

Many users (myself included) have looked for a way to enable horizontal scrolling in the Explorer view to handle long file names or deeply nested folders.

All existing search results (forums, GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, etc.) point to the `workbench.tree.horizontalScrolling` setting. However, this setting was deprecated and is no longer recognized by recent VS Code versions. This leads to confusion, as there's no clear alternative to achieve the same behavior.

### Why this matters:

* Long file names are frequently truncated.
* Tooltips are not an adequate solution when scanning multiple files quickly.
* Widening the sidebar is not always practical, especially on smaller screens.

### Request:

Please consider:

* Reintroducing `workbench.tree.horizontalScrolling` or
* Providing a new option to allow horizontal scrolling in tree views (like the Explorer).

This would greatly improve usability for developers dealing with long or nested file structures.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

I would like to request the ability to customize the format of each history item in the Source Control (SCM) Graph History view of VS Code. Currently, these items have a fixed format, and there is no way for users to define how information such as author, commit message, hash, date, etc., are displayed. This is in contrast to the flexibility offered by blame editor decorations, such as the template-based customization in GitLens.

My proposal is to provide a configuration option (for example, in `settings.json`) that allows users to define a template string or structure for SCM Graph History Items, supporting variables like ${author}, ${message}, ${hash}, ${date}, etc. The template system could also support formatting, icons, emojis, or even custom highlights, similar to `gitlens.blame.line.format`.

This would allow teams and individuals to tailor the SCM experience to their workflows, such as surfacing ticket numbers, custom tags, or visually distinguishing authors and branches. It would also provide a familiar configuration experience for users who already customize blame decorations.

Thank you for considering this feature request!

3226184903,🚀 Feature Request: Detect and Show Unused VS Code Extensions,"Hi team 👋,

I’d like to propose a feature (or underlying API capability) to help developers **detect and clean up unused VS Code extensions**.

---

### 🚨 Problem

Developers install lots of extensions to experiment, but most projects only need a handful. Over time we end up with many idle extensions that:

- **Never activate** in day‑to‑day work  
- Increase startup time and memory usage  
- Clutter the Extensions view and command palette  

There’s currently no built‑in way to know which extensions haven’t been used lately.

---

### 🌟 Requested Feature

1. **Track last‑activation timestamp** (or usage frequency) for every installed extension.  
2. Expose that data in:
   - A sortable column in the Extensions view, **“Last Used”**.  
   - A command / panel listing extensions **unused for _X_ days**.  
3. Provide quick actions to **disable** or **uninstall** those extensions.

*(Alternatively, expose an API so extension authors can implement this.)*

---

### 💡 Benefits

- Faster startup and lower memory footprint for VS Code  
- Cleaner development environments and fewer update notifications  
- Encourages mindful extension usage and security hygiene  

---

### 🛠️ Current Workarounds

| Approach | Drawbacks |
|----------|-----------|
| `code --list-extensions` + manual review | No usage info; tedious |
| Disable‑and‑wait method | Easy to forget; slow feedback loop |
| Third‑party “extension lens” tools | Show metadata but still no usage tracking |

3226069318,A Secure and Ergonomic API to Obtain Original File Paths from Webview Drag & Drop Events,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

### Resumen

Currently, it is not possible for a webview to obtain the original file system path of a file that is dropped onto it. This is a deliberate security restriction. However, this limitation makes it impossible to build certain types of powerful extensions that rely on linking back to the original source file for features like real-time editing. This proposal requests a discussion on a new, secure API or an official pattern to bridge this gap without compromising security.

### The Goal

My [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JairTorres1003.jt-view-exports-svg) provides a rich user interface within a webview to visualize components found inside user files.
The desired user workflow is as follows:

1. **Drag and Drop**: The user drags one or more source files (`.js`, `.tsx`, etc.) from their system onto the webview.
2. **Analysis and Visualization**: The extension analyzes the content of these files and displays a visual representation (e.g., a gallery of icons) within the webview.
3. **Edit in Place**: The user can click on a specific icon in the webview. This action should open the original source file in a new VS Code editor tab and navigate directly to the line and column where that component's code is defined.
4. **Real-Time Feedback**: The user can then edit the component's code in the editor, save the file, and see the changes reflected back in the webview.

To achieve step 3 and 4, access to the original, absolute file path is non-negotiable.

### The Problem

Due to the webview's security sandbox, when a file is dropped, the `DataTransfer` object is sanitized. This means:

- The `file.path` property on the `File` object is `undefined`.
- The `event.dataTransfer.getData('text/uri-list')` is empty.

This is intentional and understood as a security feature to prevent webviews from having arbitrary access to the user's file system.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75220e14-5540-4bcf-aabb-7d5f3c13da2c

### Why Current Workarounds Are Insufficient

1. The `FileReader` method (reading content and temporary file)

The most common suggested workaround is to use `FileReader` inside the webview to get the file's content, `postMessage

` it to the extension host, and have the extension save it to a temporary file.

This approach is fundamentally incompatible with our core use case. If the extension opens this temporary file for the user to edit, any changes made are saved to the temporary copy, not the user's original source file. When the session ends, the changes are lost, leading to a frustrating and destructive user experience.

2. The ""Detector and Finder"" Pattern (Webview sends filenames, Extension uses `findFiles`)

This is the most advanced and viable pattern currently available. The webview detects the drop, sends the `file.name` to the extension, and the extension uses `vscode.workspace.findFiles` to locate the file within the current workspace.

While functional, this pattern has significant drawbacks:

- **Ambiguity**: It fails if multiple files with the same name exist in the workspace, requiring additional complex UI (`showQuickPick`) to ask the user to disambiguate.
- **Limited Scope**: It only works for files that are part of the currently opened workspace. It fails if the user drags a file from their Desktop or any other location outside the workspace.
- **Complexity**: It introduces significant architectural complexity for what should be a straightforward user action.

### Feature Request

We propose the introduction of a new, secure API that allows an extension to receive file drop events with their original URIs, but where the event handler runs in the privileged extension host, not the sandboxed webview.

This would be conceptually similar to how `vscode.window.createTreeView` can accept a `TreeDragAndDropController`. The drop event happens on the UI, but the logic is handled securely by the extension's backend.

### API Proposal:

A new method on the WebviewPanel object could be introduced:

```ts
/**
 * An event that is fired when files are dropped onto the webview.
 * The handler for this event runs in the extension host and receives
 * the full URIs of the dropped files, bypassing the webview sandbox.
 */
panel.onDidDropFiles(async (uris: readonly vscode.Uri[]) => {
  // This code runs in the extension host, not the webview.
  // It has full access to the VS Code API and Node.js modules.

  console.log(
    ""Files were dropped! Paths:"",
    uris.map((u) => u.fsPath)
  );

  // The extension can now securely read the files and post the
  // necessary information (path and content) to the webview.
  const filesData = await Promise.all(
    uris.map(async (uri) => ({
      path: uri.fsPath,
    }))
  );

  panel.webview.postMessage({ command: ""filesProcessed"", payload: filesData });
});
```

#### This approach would be:

- **Safe**: The webview itself never gains access to the file paths. All file system operations are handled by the extension host, which is already trusted.
- **Ergonomic**: It provides a direct and intuitive developer experience, solving the problem at the root.
- **Powerful**: It would unlock a new class of powerful and interactive extensions that can seamlessly bridge the gap between web-based UIs and the user's local file system in a safe and predictable way.

3223485802,Auto-accept pending chat changes when committing/discarding in SCM view,"## Feature Request

### Problem
Users frequently forget to accept pending chat changes before committing or discarding changes in the SCM view. This leads to two main issues:

1. **When committing**: Changes are committed successfully, but the chat changes remain in a pending state, requiring manual acceptance afterwards
2. **When discarding**: Changes are discarded in SCM, but if there are pending chat changes, they can be restored through chat, effectively undoing the discard operation

### Proposed Solution
Automatically accept pending chat changes when:
- Committing changes through the SCM view
- Discarding changes through the SCM view

This would align the chat working set state with the SCM operations, providing a more intuitive workflow.

### Use Cases
- Developer reviews code changes in chat, finds them acceptable, commits in SCM view → chat changes should be auto-accepted
- Developer decides to discard changes in SCM view → any related pending chat changes should also be accepted/cleared to prevent restoration

### Additional Context
This issue was raised in internal discussion where multiple team members (@digitarald, @alexdima) confirmed experiencing this workflow friction.

### Alternative Considerations
- Could provide a setting to control this behavior for users who prefer manual acceptance
- Could show a confirmation dialog for the auto-acceptance action
- Could apply only to changes that overlap with the files being committed/discarded",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/255432,1

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
#### Problem Statement

Teams that use a *multi-root monorepo* often keep a dedicated `.vscode/tasks.json` file inside each package/service.  
Today those tasks are **not** surfaced automatically at the workspace level—you must either:

1. Copy every task into the top-level `tasks.json`, or  
2. Manually open the folder that owns the task before the **Run Task…** picker will show it.

Both options add friction, increase duplication, and confuse new contributors (“Why can’t I see the build task for `service-api`?”).

---

#### Proposed Solution

Introduce a single, opt-in flag in the `.code-workspace` file:

```jsonc
{
  ""folders"": [
    { ""path"": ""packages/service-api"" },
    { ""path"": ""packages/web-ui"" }
  ],
  ""autoImportTasks"": true      // <-- new flag
}
```


When `autoImportTasks` is true the workbench will, at load-time and on folder-add, automatically:

* Scan each folder opened by the workspace for .vscode/tasks.json (or tasks contributed by extensions).
* Merge those tasks into the workspace’s Task Picker.
* (Optional) Prefix the label with the folder name—e.g. [web-ui] build—to avoid collisions.
* (Optional) Allow a `skipTasks` under each folder entry to selectively skip auto importing if set to true.

Since Copilot opens `Untitled-1` 2 3 4 3000..  over and over again i need to manually close them and if 10 of them are open i get 10 annoying popups that warn me about closing the current file without saving – well the file is empty, please dont warn me.

Is it possible to add a setting that disabled warning on closing empty files?
I know it does already work (`CMD + N` & `CMD + W` = close without prompt) but the file which is opened automatically does seems to have something more to it?

Since the issue i have found is locked without any solution i have reopened it here

3219889485,launch.json – Allow one input to set multiple arguments/variables,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

Currently, VS Code’s launch.json only allows referencing a single input value per argument. There is no way to have a single user selection (e.g. from a pickString input) set multiple arguments or variables in a launch configuration.

Use case:
For workflows where a user selects a file/shot/sequence, it is often necessary to set several related arguments (e.g. path, project, shot name) based on that single selection.
At the moment, the only workaround is to encode all values into one string and parse them in the script, which is not user-friendly and makes configurations harder to maintain.

Suggestion:

Allow an input to return an object or array, so that multiple arguments can be filled based on a single selection.
Or allow some kind of mapping in launch.json so that one input can set several variables.

Example:

""inputs"": [
  {
    ""id"": ""combo"",
    ""type"": ""pickString"",
    ""options"": [
      { ""label"": ""Shot 1"", ""path"": ""..."", ""project"": ""..."", ""shot"": ""..."" },
      { ""label"": ""Shot 2"", ""path"": ""..."", ""project"": ""..."", ""shot"": ""..."" }
    ]
  }
]

And then reference ${input:combo.path}, ${input:combo.project}, etc. in configurations.

This would make complex workflows much easier and reduce duplication in launch configurations.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
I've been using VS Code for a long time now, and there's one feature I constantly wish it had - the ability to define sections within a file and navigate them easily. In short - Table of Contents.

Let's take this Vue file for example -

```
<style></style>

<template>
    <div class=""section-1"">
        <span>A lot of nested elements inside this section.</span>
    </div>

    <div class=""section-2"">
        <span>A lot of nested elements inside this section.</span>
    </div>

    <div class=""section-3"">
        <span>A lot of nested elements inside this section.</span>
    </div>

    <div class=""section-4"">
        <span>A lot of nested elements inside this section.</span>
    </div>

    <div class=""section-5"">
        <span>A lot of nested elements inside this section.</span>
    </div>
</template>

<script setup>

// Imports

// Props

// Variables

// Watchers

// Methods

// Lifecycle hooks

// Computed properties

// Emit events

</script>
```
Each `<div>` section in the template might have a ton of nested elements. And in the `<script setup>` block, things can get long really quickly - dozens of lines just for props or methods, for example.

### The Problem:

The only ""navigation"" right now is manually scrolling or using comment dividers like:

```
=============== Methods ===============
```

But that still requires you to scroll through the file and visually scan for those markers. Not ideal for large files.

### The Idea:

Imagine if we had a table of contents sidebar per file - something that could -

- Auto-detect or allow manual marking of sections (like headings in Markdown).
- Show a list of sections: template > section-1, section-2, etc., and script > imports, methods, etc.
- Let you quickly jump to each one without endless scrolling.

3216556240,Ability to disable `updateImportsOnFileMove` for specific files in TypeScript language server,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

Hi,


I'm looking for a way to disable `updateImportsOnFileMove` for the imports inside of specific files. Or: in more general terms, to be able to specify this setting for specific files, not just in a user or workspace scope.

Currently, the `typescript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled` setting can only be set to `always`/`prompt`/`never`.

Ideally, I'd like to configure my codebase to use `always`. For certain files though, this is not feasible, but turning of this feature for an entire repository is very harsh, I'd rather not do that.

Why is this not feasible for certain files?
In cases where a tool is used which automatically generates a TypeScript file (which contains certain imports) _when those imports change path_, I'm running into the issue below.

Both some tool (Tanstack Router TSR CLI in my case) and the TypeScript VS Code integration try to update this file at the same time. The tool generates a whole new file, TypeScript tries to update the imports. In other words: two new versions of the file are generated, more or less at the same time, and they're different.
The file pops open in VS Code with unsaved changes. The version shown is the version generated by TypeScript, where only the imports are updated. I'm assuming some sort of race conditioning is happening which triggers this behavior in VS Code.

This problem disappears when I set `typescript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled` to `never`. Obviously, I then lose the benefits of this feature everywhere else in my repo.

Because this is a codegen file entirely generated by one specific tool, I don't want another tool (TypeScript) to bother with it. The generated file should always be accepted as is, it should never be automatically adjusted by TypeScript.
I'd like be able to either configure `updateImportsOnFileMove` for specific files using a blob, or hard disable it with a TS comment.

I have never been able to delete files from the Source Control tab.  I get, ""Are you sure you want to delete"" and the only options are Cancel and Move to Trash.  Move to Trash says ""Git: Failed ..."" and then Cancel or Open Git Log.  After this fails, it does not give me the option to delete anyways.  

Shift+Delete does nothing. v1.100
OS: Linux

The feature request is: offer the two options upfront: delete and move to trash.  Delete should have nothing to do with Git and simply operate directly on the file system.  This part of the code has been very problematic over the years and there are a number of issues about this.  It is pretty useful to be able to delete files in this way though, it proves a unique selection that can span directories; so this is a valuable feature.  I don't know why the fall-back is not triggered now but, at one point, I did see something along the lines of ""delete anyways"" but that has stopped popping up and it never worked anyways.

Rather, I think a small feature change is more valuable than trying to fix this again like the other approaches in the past.  I'm more interested in the delete functionality; a percentage of other users are going to agree.  I'm confident that if you allow bypassing of the trash up-front, it will at least cut down on the issues reported on this topic.  Issues such as:

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

I would like the ability to specify in a `.code-workspace` file a remote port that needs to be forwarded and a specific local port to use instead of the same port as the remote host.

If I am understanding correctly, I can provide a config like follows to enable port forwarding for ports 443 and 8443 from the host machine to my local machine:

```json
    ""remote.portsAttributes"": {
        
        ""443"": {
            ""protocol"": ""https""
        },
        ""8443"": {
            ""protocol"": ""https""
        }
    }
```

In my environments, I would like to be able to amend the code-workspace file with a config that always forwards port 3341 from the host machine to port 3345 on my local machine. I've manually done this in the VS Code GUI, but would prefer to have it part of the workspace config for portability reasons.

The example shown in the visual config editor also implies that configuration is possible for ranges of ports as well as regular expressions and/or file paths, but I am having significant difficulty finding documentation to explain those use cases or to see an overall list of valid keys/config options for forwarding ports.

I also reviewed the specification at containers.dev regarding portAttributes, but it was unclear whether VS Code has feature parity with that, and there were not sufficient examples to see if my use case was supported.

Consideration of this feature would be much appreciated, or possibly a shove in the right direction toward finding the documentation around the config format. Thanks!",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/254701,1

Hi,

In our company, we program using AL language and over the years we arrived to some useful configuration for our VS Code workspaces.
The workspace settings are pretty complex - see the template below.

The problem is that we make changes to this template every few months or so (add useful setting or a new extension, etc.). This means, that other projects (hundreds of them already) do not have these changes and remain as they were (the one that prompted me to do this was from 2022).

We would like to split workspace into two configurations: shared settings (accessible using URL) and actual workspace (in the Git repository). See suggested shared settings template syntax and workspace file syntax below.

The external template files should be cached locally so even if you go offline the last received workspace settings would still apply. Changes in external files should only be received when workspace is opened - no need to poll for changes continuously (at least for us).

There should also be option for folder settings templates, that would work similarly - add array properties ""includedSettings"": [list of urls] and ""includedExtensions"": [list of urls] to .vscode/settings.json and .vscode/extensions.json respectively.

Thanks.

3211921156,Use more powerful `v`-mode (`unicodeSets`) instead of `u`-mode (`unicode`) for regex search,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

Feature request: Use the more powerful [`v`-mode (`unicodeSets`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicodeSets) instead of [`u`-mode (`unicode`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicode) for regex search.

For example, in a file containing the text ""hello, world!"", regex searching for `[[a-z]--[f-v]]` should match `e`, `w`, and `d` ([playground](https://regex101.com/?regex=%5B%5Ba-z%5D--%5Bf-v%5D%5D&flags=gv&flavor=javascript&testString=hello%2C+world%21)).

Hi vscode team,

I have searched for ""collapse"" and ""source control"" but I couldn't find my Feature Request among the many many new issues. I hope it is not a duplicated.

**My Feature Request is to allow the tree structure rendered in the Source Control panel to be collapsable and expandable** like many other tree structures (i.e. in Explorer, etc.). I am not 100% if this is done, I do not think so. The usual button for collapse seems to be to fold all the repos in the panel - not the folders within a repo.

Thank you for your work. Best Code Editor! Go Team!

### Problem

When I use *Go to symbol* I almost always use it to go to a method.

In Sublime Text you can search for methods and class definitions using the `@` prefix in the fuzzy search (Ctrl + R).

<img width=""608"" height=""130"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c9f1ce-f890-4559-9616-a1c202c30b45"" />

In VSCode we can use *Go to symbol*, but it includes <ins>all</ins> type of symbols.

<img width=""608"" height=""366"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66da265c-5596-48f5-97b0-d5c86306ef02"" />

Even if we use `@:` to group the symbols, then we still have the problem that anonymous functions are included, as can be seen in the screenshot above (`rows.map`).

In Lua it's even worse with it including parameters (perhaps because of an extension), whereas in Sublime Text it neatly lists the methods.

1. Set which types of symbols should appear in the fuzzy search.
2. Set whether you want to include anonymous functions or not.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/254333,1

Hello,
as it's common to edit multiple columns by using the multiple column selection mode, it would be very convinient for users to use a shortcut to activate this text editing mode. Now users may only access this nice feature by using menu through pointing with mice.

<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

When working with very large source files, it can be challenging to focus on and edit a specific function or code block. I suggest introducing a ""Function Focus Mode"" that enables users to:

- Show only the source code of a selected function or code scope (e.g., class, method, or block).
- Restrict all editing, search, and replace operations to the visible range.
- Seamlessly switch between focused and full-file views.
- Optionally, allow expanding the focus to include related scopes (e.g., adjacent functions, containing classes).

**Benefits:**

- Helps avoid the common pitfall where, while scrolling through a long file, the user unintentionally ends up viewing or editing a different function—ensuring focus remains strictly on the intended code block.
- Makes it easier to work with large files by reducing distractions.
- Prevents accidental edits outside the targeted scope.
- Improves code review and refactoring workflows.

**Example Workflow:**

1. User right-clicks a function in the outline or code and selects “Focus on Function.”
2. The editor hides all other code except for the chosen function.
3. All editing and search/replace operations apply only within the focused scope.
4. User can exit focus mode to return to the full file as needed.

**Related Features:**  
While VS Code supports code folding, Go to Symbol, and search within selection, none of these restrict the editor context and operations as strictly as described above.

Completions are interfering with snippets and disrespecting settings and keyboard shortcut `when` conditions that should be preventing unwanted acceptance.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In your snippets, add:

```jsonc
{
  ""console.debug"": { ""prefix"": ""cdbg"", ""body"": ""console.debug(${1:`$2`$3});$0"" },
}
```

2. In your editor, type `cdbg` then `tab`.

3. You'll be on the outer backticks in the snippet. A Copilot completion will likely appear almost immediately. You're now going to press `tab` to progress to the next position in the snippet.

You're iterating quickly and the completion has appeared a fraction of a second before you press `tab`, almost like it was in the bushes waiting to sabotage your attempt to use the snippet.

Having now pressed `tab`, the completion supersedes the snippet workflow, interpreting the tab as acceptance and ending the snippet workflow, rather than respecting the `editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions` setting and passing the `tab` on to the snippet provider.

VS Code's clone feature ignores if a repo has already been cloned. It now creates a new folder with a suffix (like -1, -2, etc.) if the folder already exists.

### Feature Request: Add ""Close Working Trees"" option to tab context menu

When using GitHub Copilot in **agent mode**, every file that Copilot edits opens a new tab showing a diff. These tabs are labeled with the file name followed by **“(Working Tree)”**. While this is helpful for reviewing changes, these tabs accumulate quickly and clutter the editor tab bar.

I often find myself manually closing each “(Working Tree)” tab, which interrupts my workflow.

#### Suggested Solution

Add a new option to the file tab right-click context menu:

> **Close Working Trees**

This would automatically close all open tabs that include `(Working Tree)` in their title.

#### Benefits

- Streamlines workflows for users working heavily with Copilot agent.
- Reduces visual clutter.
- Saves time and avoids repetitive manual tab management.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253977,1

* Placeholder text should not have ""..."". It should be ""Select a location to create the custom mode""
* User Data Dir should be first (this is the primary use case, users just create mode once and share across workspaces)

3197228365,Manually created folding ranges don't persist across editor panes,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Preparations:
- Open VS Code and open two editor panes.
- Open a .txt or .log file in one pane.
- Create one or more manual folding ranges in that file (select a few lines, press `ctrl-K ctrl-,`). 
- Close the file.

Experiment 1 (works as expected):
- Open the file in the same editor pane where you created the folding ranges.
- The file still has the folding range, and when you open the file, the range is  in the same state as it was when you closed the file (that is, collapsed or expanded).

Experiment 2 (doesn't work as expected):
- Open the file in the other editor pane.
- Expected: Same behavior as in experiment 1.
- Actual: The folding range is not present.

Maximizing the panel or secondary sidebar should behave consistently regarding visibility of the primary sidebar. Either:
Always hide the primary sidebar when maximizing another UI element, or
Never hide it when maximizing another UI element.

Actual Behavior:
Maximizing the panel keeps the primary sidebar visible.

3192396077,Feature Request: Auto-Hide Terminal and Sidebar on Editor Focus,"Feature Request: Auto-Hide Terminal and Sidebar on Editor Focus
Problem Description

VS Code users frequently use the integrated terminal (Ctrl+J) and sidebar (Ctrl+B). Currently, these panels must be manually hidden to focus on the editor, which disrupts workflow and reduces screen space. This manual action is inefficient, especially when the user's intent to focus on the editor is clear from clicking within it.
Proposed Solution

Implement an ""Auto-Hide"" feature for the integrated terminal and sidebar. When enabled, these panels would automatically hide upon a click anywhere within the main code editor area.
How it would work:

    User Interaction: User clicks within an open code file in the editor.

    Trigger Event: This click triggers a check.

    Auto-Hide Action:

        If the terminal is visible and ""Auto-Hide Terminal"" is enabled, it hides.

        If the sidebar is visible and ""Auto-Hide Sidebar"" is enabled, it hides.

    Re-showing Panels: Panels can still be brought back via Ctrl+J, Ctrl+B, or by clicking their activity bar/status bar icons.

The full Visual Studio 2022 IDE offers a similar and highly valued auto-hide functionality for various tool windows (e.g., Solution Explorer, Properties Window, Output Window) when not in focus. This demonstrates the utility and user demand for such a feature, and its implementation in VS Code would provide a familiar and productive experience.
Configuration Options (Proposed)

To ensure flexibility, the feature should be configurable:

    ""workbench.panel.terminal.autoHideOnEditorFocus"": Boolean (default false) to enable/disable terminal auto-hide.

    ""workbench.sideBar.autoHideOnEditorFocus"": Boolean (default false) to enable/disable sidebar auto-hide.

    ""workbench.activityBar.autoHideOnEditorFocus"": (Optional) Boolean (default false) to enable/disable Activity Bar auto-hide for maximum screen real estate.

Benefits

    Improved Workflow Efficiency: Seamless transition from panels to coding without extra keypresses.

    Enhanced Focus: Maximizes editor screen real estate, aiding concentration.

    Cleaner UI: Reduces visual clutter.

    Better Experience on Smaller Screens: Especially beneficial for laptops.

    Intuitive Interaction: Aligns with user intent.

This feature would significantly enhance the user experience by making VS Code more adaptive and efficient for daily coding tasks.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253275,1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create your own MCP Server. 
2. Host it remotely in Azure, using API Management as a front-end
3. Configure OAuth authentication using API Management
4. OAuth authentication will fail due to /register not being done by VSCode, which its should according to: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization

Flow of actions observed in logs.
1. oauth authorize
2. oauth callback

Expected flow of actions
1. oauth register
2. oauth authorize
3. oauth callback

I tested the same setup using @modelcontextprotocol/inspector. There the oauth flow works as expected, and /register is executed by the inespector.

3186580238,Feature: VSCode capability to register a clientId for MCP OAuth,"When doing the OAuth handshake in vscode for MCP resource servers, the flow is to perform the Dynamic Client Resolution to the respective authorization server. When the IDP does not support DSR, the only other way to provide a clientId is to build an extension and include the `authorizationServerGlobs` and `authorizationServers`, which I would rather not do.

Instead, it would be great to add the capability defined in the [MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization#dynamic-client-registration) when the authorization server does not support DSR (Option 1):

> Any authorization servers that do not support Dynamic Client Registration need to provide alternative ways to obtain a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials). For one of these authorization servers, MCP clients will have to either:
> 1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials) specifically for the MCP client to use when interacting with that authorization server, or
> 2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the server).

Reference Issue:
> DCR is required for MCP auth using any authorization server that does not map to an AuthenticationProvider. The API that this issue talks about is how you make that association which lifts the requirement of DCR. In other words, this API delegates auth to a registered AuthenticationProvider which has a client id already.

CAPI will be picking up this work in July, and here are the things we probably need to do on the Client side to have a nice Auto experience. I might be missing something - so do chime in and let me know:

- [ ] Figure out business case (what is the multiplier) and available models for Auto @isidorn 
- [ ] Change model dropdown visuals such that there is no ""Standard / Premium models"". There is no included, it is `0x`. so basically each model just has a multiplier, and that's it.
- [ ] Chat needs to call into CAPI before request sent to figure out what model will actually be used. Or what is the set of models that have capacity. CAPI can provide a new API for this. The question is how often does Chat call into CAPI to figure this out? Once per agent session? What is sent as part of the request (prompt + history?) What is the actual API contract?
- [ ] Once CAPI gives us the model to use via previous request, we construct the prompt and everything for that model, and then Chat sends ""auto request but use model A that you just told me""
- [ ] Auto needs to be transparent (for users to love it):
  - [ ] Figure out with CAPI how do we show a set of models Auto chooses from. Is this just a `details` that we show on hover in model dropdown, or something else. The goal is that the user is aware of what models Auto might pick before the request is made
  - [ ] On response done, we need to render what model was actually used. I personally like this LMStudio UI (but we can use whatever we find best

I do not know how this would work in Inline Chat. Ideally same API flow, but as step 1 transparent UI on model used does not have to be there.

3184810625,Support new variable ${targetDir} in terminal profiles for right-click 'Open in Terminal',"# Feature Request: Add `${targetDir}` variable to terminal profiles

## Problem

When right-clicking a folder in the VS Code Explorer and selecting **""Open in Integrated Terminal""**, the built-in terminal correctly starts in the clicked directory. However, when using a **custom terminal profile** via `terminal.integrated.profiles.*`, this context is lost.

Currently, `${cwd}` and `${workspaceFolder}` are the only available variables, and both point to the workspace root – **not the folder that was right-clicked**.

## Why it matters

This limitation makes it impossible to:

- Launch container shells or scripts with contextual awareness of the folder selected.
- Provide smart terminal profiles that behave like the default one.

It severely limits the usefulness of custom terminal profiles for advanced workflows, especially when combined with Docker, SSH, or remote mounts.

## Proposed Solution

Introduce a new variable:

```json
${targetDir}
```

…that resolves to the actual folder the user right-clicked when opening the terminal. If the terminal is launched from the command palette or normal view, `${targetDir}` should fall back to `${cwd}` or `${workspaceFolder}`.

## Example Usage

```json
""terminal.integrated.profiles.linux"": {
  ""SSH to Server"": {
    ""path"": ""/usr/bin/ssh"",
    ""args"": [
      ""-tt"",
      ""user@host"",
      ""cd \\""${targetDir}\\"" || cd ~; exec bash""
    ]
  }
}
```

## Workaround Today

Not possible. `${cwd}` always resolves to the project root when using a custom terminal profile – even if a subfolder was explicitly clicked.

## Request Summary

Please add a `${targetDir}` variable to allow custom terminal profiles to receive the actual path that the user opened the terminal for. This would bring custom profiles to feature parity with the default terminal behavior.

Thanks for your consideration!

3179030225,Agent abandons build if it takes longer than 15 seconds,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

If a build takes longer than 15 seconds the agent gives up, rewrites its build request and tries again (which obviously also fails). It should just wait for the build to finish (however long that takes).

This blocks any workflow that requires the agent to run tests (and that also takes longer than 15 seconds)

**Steps to reproduce:**

- Have a build that takes more than 15 seconds 
- Give the prompt
- Could you run the tests in [redacted] and resolve any failures
- AI correctly starts running the test
- 15 seconds goes by

**Expected results:**
- AI continues to wait

**Actual results:**
- AI gets bored and says ""The tests are taking a long time to run. Let me check if there are specific test configurations or if I can run them more efficiently""
- The AI comes up with another command line to run that won't be any quicker
- AI gets bored again and gives up on running the test, declares that everything is probably fine already

I don't understand why there is any limit on how long it will wait, surely the AI isn't ""active"" again until the run finishes and it can look at the results

We have some scenarios we are creating custom chat modes for that we know do better with particular LLMs.

I think it's fine if a user changes the mode, but I'd like to make sure they get the best experience.

When a user switches back to say Agent mode, the LLM should change back to the one they were using previously - very important if the custom mode is using a more expensive model.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/252339,1
3173283020,[Accessibility] Add a Setting to Toggle Automatic Opening of Files Edited by Copilot Agent,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

CC @meganrogge 

When using Copilot in agent or edit mode, files that the Copilot agent is editing automatically open in Visual Studio Code. This can be disruptive for screen reader users, as their navigation commands (like single letter navigation for moving between headings or editors) can accidentally cause unwanted input in these files, potentially introducing errors or disrupting the editing process.

To improve accessibility and user experience, it would be helpful to have a setting that allows users to toggle this automatic file opening on or off.

Thank you for considering this feature request!

Adding a `# prettier-ignore` comment prevents the formatting but the parse also doesn't support comments so there are still issues reported.

and then closed the issue as ""completed"" and added the ""duplicate"" label without linking the exact issue that was duplicated.

Acknowledging a limitation doesn't resolve the user's need for a cleaner, more efficient search experience within the primary search viewlet.

Using search editor preview is a workaround, not a ""completed"" solution to the requested feature. This is not that much better than using regex `Automobile.+` every time instead of `Automobile` or clicking the 'x'.

Favorite/Star searches

I often do complex regex searches and need to switch between different searches.
Currently it means keeping a text file open on the side with my regex patterns to copy/paste into the searchbox. 

It would be cool if we can just click a little star and `the current search query and it's options` be remembered.

I'd like to have a ""workspaces"" property that I can use to specify which workspaces I want this extension to be enabled for. This property may support glob patterns. If you want this extension enabled for all workspaces you'd put an asterisk.

    ""github.copilot"": {

# Feature Request: Enable Tab Switching in VS Code Using ""Alt + Tab"" Functionality Similar to Microsoft Edge

## Description:

It would be highly beneficial to introduce an option in Visual Studio Code that allows users to switch between open editor tabs using the ""Alt + Tab"" shortcut, replicating the behavior currently available in Microsoft Edge.

This feature would enhance multitasking and navigation efficiency within the editor, especially for users who are accustomed to this workflow in other Microsoft applications. The existing implementation in Microsoft Edge provides a seamless and intuitive way to cycle through tabs, and integrating a similar mechanism into VS Code would significantly improve the user experience.

For reference, here is the official Microsoft documentation describing the current ""Alt + Tab"" functionality in Windows and Microsoft Edge:
[How to multitask in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-multitask-in-windows-b4fa0333-98f8-ef43-e25c-06d4fb1d6960#alt-tab)

## Proposed Enhancement:

* Add an optional setting in VS Code to enable tab switching using ""Alt + Tab"".
* Ensure the behavior mimics the tab-switching experience in Microsoft Edge, allowing users to quickly preview and navigate between open tabs.

15%-20% are good numbers.
For example, sonnet 4 has 200k, 16k = 12.5%
Gemini 2.5pro has 1M input, 64K output = 15%

Thus my recommendation is that we cap max_output at 15% of input.

# Problem
Currently, VS Code only allows enabling or disabling entire MCP servers. While we can disable individual tools on a per-session basis through the agent mode interface, this approach has significant limitations:
- Repetitive: We must manually disable unwanted tools in every new chat session (except if i missed a way to do it)
- No persistence: Tool preferences don't carry over between sessions
- Error-prone: Easy to forget to disable risky tools, leading to accidental usage

This forces us to either accept all tools from a server, disable the entire server, or waste time managing tools repeatedly in each session.

# Proposed Solution
Add configuration options to manage individual tools from MCP servers through settings, providing persistent control that eliminates the need for per-session management if we want

I would like an option for the minimap to autohide, and **only** show up after I start scrolling. The current auto-hide shows up on mouseover, but for me this is misleading because if I want to click into some code that would appear under the minimap, as soon as I move the mouse to that spot, the minimap shows up. Then my click lands on the minimap and scrolls me to another spot in the code.
So perhaps the autohide setting could be turned into a select menu with the options ""none"", ""mouseover"" and ""scroll"", meaning no autohide, autohide/show-on-mouseover, or autohide/show-on-scroll.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251745,1

Since I'm currently playing around quite a lot with tasks, I often get to a point where I feel like there would be, or know that there is, a command variable for what I want to do.
However, most of the times command variables are not well documented or [hidden](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/main/docs/cmake-settings.md#command-substitution).
The [Variables Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/reference/variables-reference#_command-variables) briefly mentions that they exist and that extensions may bring their own, but most often they are not well documented.

Hence I propose to document the command variables in the features tab of the extension (maybe alongside normal commands).
Default command variables, if there are any, should probably be documented on the aforementioned Variable Reference web page.

Suggested Implementation:

A command like Delete All Comments in the Command Palette.

Optional keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C) that users can customize.

Should work across all languages supported by VS Code.

I'm currently forced to use an older version of the C# extension since newer versions no longer support MacOS 12 (I'm on an older MacBook which means I can't update to the latest OS version). However, when this specific version is installed, the extension icon in the sidebar still has a ""1"" notification counter telling me to update the extension. It's a minor issue, but it can be somewhat irritating to have a notification I can't get rid of, and it makes it harder to tell if any of the other installed extensions actually require updating/restarting. I propose that extensions that have a user-specified version installed (i.e. installed via the ""Install Specific Version..."" option) should not count towards the extension notification counter in the sidebar.

3151238514,Feature Request: Copilot Terminal Awareness for Long-Running or Error-Prone Commands,"**Context:**  
From @karthiknadig: The chat agent can run long-lived or error-prone terminal commands, and Copilot remains unaware of what’s happening in the terminal. This limits its ability to provide timely suggestions or detect inefficiencies.

### Problem:
- Inefficient commands (e.g. redundant builds) go unnoticed.
- Repeated errors or warnings receive no guidance.
- Copilot has no visibility into command failures unless prompted.

### Proposal:
Allow Copilot to (optionally) observe terminal output to:
- Detect repeated errors or warnings and suggest fixes.
- Recommend command optimizations (e.g., caching, watch mode).
- Proactively offer help when commands fail (e.g., “Want help debugging this?”).
- Reply to in terminal prompts like Y/N

### Questions:
- We already have diagnostic awareness for tasks. Should we introduce dynamic problem matchers for terminals? 
- How would users feel about terminal output sharing?
- How would we parse the output?

3150523634,Improve implicit context in chat,"My suggestion:

1) When Chat is EMPTY - whatever the user sees visually, the chat will get as context automatically, and we render it (this means if users has two groups side by side we add both editors as context). 
2) When Chat is not EMPTY, or the user manually edited the context in any way we stop automatically adding stuff.
3) In whatever situation: if an active editor is not part of the context we render it grayed out / italic as we do today. There is only one active editor (even for multiple groups)
4) If user has selection in any of the files in context, we render the selection in context (as before) and pass that to the LLM 

My proposal makes a difference between EMPTY chat and non empty. The reason for that is that EMPTY chat the user is starting, and we need to automatically help them fill out the context. As soon as they already started the conversation there is context. And we should train users to start a new chat for new topics (they will get a better result with crisp context). 

It is also important to track as soon as user makes any manual edit to the context. By doing that the user is saying ""I want to be in control and will figure out context"" - so in that case we also stop auto adding active file.

3150445814,Allow rendering complex HTML screen reader content when using the EditContext API,"Currently the input is powered by one of two methods:
- The hidden text-area

```
<textarea>
content
</textarea>
```

- The EditContext API

```
<div editContext>
content
</div>
```

In both cases the content is rendered as hidden plain text with the font-size and font-family defined in the settings. This will be an issue in the future when variable font sizes are adopted. If we set decorations so that a part of the editor text should have a non-default font-size and font-family, we'd like the screen readers to still correctly track the modified text position with the modified font-size and font-family. As such we need to render the screen reader with a complex HTML structure which reflects the variable font-size and font-family. This will only be possible when the EditContext API is enabled because it is not possible to define a text-area with variable font-sizes within it. In essence the feature request is to allow rendering the hidden EditContext screen reader content as follows:

```
<div editContext>
<div><span>content line 1 </span></div>
<div><span>content line 2 </span></div>
<div><span>content line 3 </span></div>

In Rust, modules follow a prescribed directory structure that follows one of two patterns:

Within a repo, the Chat Mode would allow me to get GHCP into __Focused Mode__ for implementing specific tasks, much like I am in a 'persona mode' when planning, coding, testing, IaC, etc.

Some top of mind:

- [x] Selection of tool (sets) - this already is part of the current preview :clap:
- [ ] Selection of applicable `instructions` files
- [ ] Allow for applying custom general instructions `copilot-instructions.md` to ensure I can overwrite repo generic guidelines when relevant (especially valuable in mono repo)
- [ ] Specify which folders the mode has access to for read-only 
- [ ] Specify which folders the mode has access for read/write (again value in mono repo)
- [ ] Selection of available models
- [ ] Other ideas?

Some of the custom instruction applicable settings could be solved in several ways, depending on where we want inter-dependencies.
One idea for selection of custom instructions files at mode level is to have the `mode` field added to the metadata of the custom instruction file.

3138637886,"Urgent: Copilot Agent Context loss after ""Summarized conversation history""","### Select Topic Area

Bug

### Copilot Feature Area

Copilot Agent Mode

### Body


## Problem Description

Copilot Agents have become significantly less effective due to a critical context loss issue. The main problems are:

### Context Loss After Conversation Summarization
- After extended conversations, Copilot Agent loses important context
- This occurs specifically when ""Summarized conversation history"" appears
- The agent becomes unable to maintain continuity with previous discussion points

### Solution Interruption
- When the agent is actively working on solving an issue and finds potential solutions, the ""Summarized conversation history"" feature suddenly activates
- This interruption causes the agent to lose track of both the problem context and proposed solutions
- The agent then enters an infinite loop, unable to recover the lost information

## Suggested Solution

**Revert to Previous Behavior:**
- Return to the previous version's approach, where ""Summarized conversation history"" was not automatically triggered
- Instead of summarizing conversations, utilize memory management to retain context from older chat sessions


## Request for Action

Please consider implementing an option to:
1. Disable automatic conversation summarization
2. Allow users to control when and how conversation history is managed
3. Provide better context retention mechanisms that don't interrupt active problem-solving sessions

This change would significantly improve the user experience and restore the tool's effectiveness for extended development sessions.

## Steps To Reproduce
### Prerequisites

VSCode (version >1.99) with the latest Copilot Chat extension (version > 0.26.7)

### Reproduction Steps

Start a new Copilot Agent conversation

Open VSCode
Initiate Copilot Chat
Switch to Agent mode

3138129602,Completion tooltips on method signatures differ from tooltips on hover,"When a method signature in the editor has comments a nice description is shown in both the completions experience and the hover info tooltip experience.  However the UX is different.  In hover you get syntax highlighting in the method signature and the editor uses the screen efficiently to show the information.  In completions it seems a fixed box size and there is now a loss in syntax highlighting.

Examples:

On info hover (mouse over the method):

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf4bc85a-53d7-45ce-bf2a-f3df1fb3d6df)

On completion (typing, using the method and seeing the tooltip popup):

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2801f3f7-6207-48f0-890e-7583e4e5e53b)

Observe these two problematic issues:

- tiny space given (fixed box size, no wrap, no scroll ability)
- lack of colorization on the signature different than the hover

I'm working on the [Microsoft C# DevKit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-c-sharp-dev-kit) VS Code extension. In particular, I'm trying to improve the experience for users who create project templates.
 
We have a flow like this:

1. User opens VS Code with no open folder
2. User invokes our extension's command to create a new C# project
3. We create the project in a folder then call `vscode.openFolder`
4. The folder opens, and some default files are opened in the editor

However step three kills the extension host process, so we cannot execute code for step four. Today, we skip the last step, which isn't a great experience for our users.
 
I have tried using `vscode.ExtensionContext.globalState` to hand off some startup state to the incoming extension instance, and while this does work there's some time before the documents open (several seconds), so the user can be surprised when documents open unannounced after they've started using the workspace.
 
I'm wondering what other options might exist. One idea is to create some configuration for the new workspace before opening it, so that it launches with the documents open immediately. I'm not sure how I'd do that though, or if it's even a viable idea.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251202,1

3133868303,Feature Request: Built-in Syntax Highlighting for Unknown Languages,"# Feature Request: Built-in Syntax Highlighting for Unknown Languages

**Summary:**  
VS Code should include a fallback syntax highlighter that automatically provides basic syntax highlighting for files with unknown or custom extensions, without requiring a full TextMate grammar or extension.

**Motivation:**  
- Many developers create or experiment with custom languages (like Hexon) or new file formats.  
- Currently, VS Code treats unknown file types as plain text with no syntax highlighting, which hurts readability and development flow.  
- Having a generic, heuristic-based fallback highlighter would provide immediate visual structure—highlighting common tokens like keywords, strings, comments, numbers, and punctuation.  
- This would reduce the barrier to experimenting with new languages and improve the user experience for niche/custom file types.

**Possible Implementation Ideas:**  
- A default “generic” grammar with common programming constructs.  
- Optional AI or pattern-based heuristic highlighting for unknown file extensions.  
- A user toggle to enable/disable this fallback highlighting globally.

**Benefits:**  
- Immediate, helpful syntax highlighting for any file, known or unknown.  
- Encourages innovation and experimentation with new languages.  
- Improves accessibility and readability for custom scripts/configs.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
Hi team,

I’d like to request a feature that would allow the Copilot Agent to automatically switch between models before performing a task, based on the context or user-defined preferences, and to handle rate-limit scenarios seamlessly.

Use Case
	•	I often use Gemini for backend tasks and Claude for UI-related tasks, but manually changing models each time is cumbersome.
	•	When one model’s rate limit is reached, it would be ideal for the agent to automatically fall back to another model without any disruption.

Suggested Functionality
	1.	Context-Driven Model Selection
	•	Configure preferred models by task type (e.g., backend vs. UI).
	•	Allow workspace or project settings to define these mappings.
	2.	Automatic Failover on Rate Limits
	•	Detect when a model has hit its rate limit or quota.
	•	Instantly switch to a secondary model (e.g., from Gemini → Claude) to maintain workflow continuity.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251062,1

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

I want profiles to be stored in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` so that I can more easily manage them with a typical ""dotfiles"" / ""home manager"" setup (i.e. where `${HOME}/.config` is synced with a git repository).

The simplest solution that is backwards compatible with the current behaviour would be to allow users to specify a custom directory for profiles (including the default profile). For existing installations can remain where it is.

New installations should use `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `${HOME}/.config` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set. ",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/251041,1

<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

In the diff editor, add a toggle to choose between 
1) ""Highlight changes in both Line and Text-fragments"" 
2) ""Highlight changes only in Text-fragments"" 

### Line and text-fragments highlighted (current state)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb0fa5a-b8f1-40d8-bca5-5ef10eab7398)

### Only text-fragments highlighted (proposed feature after pushing the toggle button)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a73950d4-ba6d-43de-bb62-468dd5a49d00)

### Motivation

As can be seen from the images, I write mathematical papers in Latex. In Latex, a single editor-line usually contains one whole paragraph. Hence, line-highlighting only tells that there is a change somewhere in the paragraph. To spot the actual changes, one has to scan over the whole paragraph. This is often difficult, because the text-fragments do not pop out because of their similar color.

### Current workaround

This feature can already be achieved by the user by manually editing the settings file like this:

```
    ""workbench.colorCustomizations"": {
        ""diffEditor.insertedLineBackground"": ""#FFff0000"",
        ""diffEditor.removedLineBackground"": ""#FFff0000"",
        ""diffEditor.insertedTextBackground"": ""#FFff0088"",
        ""diffEditor.removedTextBackground"": ""#FF000088""
    },
```

That is, the highlighting of lines can be removed by setting the color's alpha-value to 0. In the above settings, I have also made the alpha-value of text-fragments higher to make them stand out even more. Now the manual ""toggle"" is commenting or uncommenting these settings.

When using the peek view (such as when using `Go to References`), it would be nice to open multiple files in new tabs at the same time.

Currently, if I want to make changes in each of the referencing files, I have to either:
- Open a single file, make changes, go back to referenced file, and search for references again
- Use mini peek editor (this is a tough constraint when working on larger refactors)

C++ dev here. Looking for a [shortcut to jump to the first error in the build output](https://superuser.com/questions/1809661/visual-studio-code-how-to-jump-to-the-first-build-error-in-build-terminal). It would save so much time scrolling up or searching manually to find the first error.

The Problems tab isn't helpful. Errors are long and include many important contextual ""note:"" lines. Investigating the first error first is important.

One simple idea is stopping the build output auto-scrolling as soon as the problem matcher hits an error. Would this be easy?

Open to other ideas too. Anything to get the first error on-screen quickly. I love C++ as it can catch more problems at compile time, and I'd like that process to be as smooth as possible.

[Edited title. previousl ""Stop the build output window scrolling on first error""]

-----

I tried writing an extension but there's no API to allow scrolling to a line in the build output (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79063). An extension would also have to find the first error, maybe based on new _Problems_ appearing during a build, or monitor the output itself?

You can press F8 to go to the first problem in the current editor but that's useless, because 90% of the time I need those ""note:"" lines to understand the error. Also, F8 goes to the first error in the current file, which isn't always the first error in the build output. Also, it's not necessarily a build error because F8 include items from intellisense, spellcheckers etc. The Problems window has the same issues and and there's no link back to the terminal where the real info is. It's also not sorted by build output occurance.

You can set `-Wfatal-errors` but that's dangerous as sometimes the very next error is important. I used to use this until I got bit by [gcc printing errors out of order](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20018150/1888983).

VS Code supports multiple profiles, each with different settings, extensions, and configurations. However, the **active profile name is not accessible from the integrated terminal**, making it difficult to write terminal scripts or commands that behave differently depending on the current profile.

A common example is:

    code --profile ""<current profile name>"" --install-extension path/to/extension.vsix

But there’s currently no way to get `<current profile name>` from inside the integrated terminal.

An exemplary issue suffering from this: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1592

### Use Case  
- Use different profiles for teams, languages, or environments  
- Automate tasks (install extensions, configure tools) based on profile  
- Improve terminal scripting in profile-specific ways

### Request  
Please expose the active profile name via one or more of the following:

- An environment variable like `VSCODE_PROFILE`  
- A CLI command: `code --get-current-profile`  

### Workaround  
You can manually set `terminal.integrated.env.*` in each profile’s settings, but this:

- Requires duplication
- Can go out of sync with the actual profile name

### Thanks  
This feature would make profiles much more powerful and allow for better automation and developer experience within VS Code.

My simplified end goal is the following:
I have files in this structure

```
components/
├─┬ item/
│ └─┬ item.js
│   └ utils.js
└─┬ b/
  └── b.js
```

(`item` and `b` could be any name)
I would like these labels:
- `components/item/utils.js` would be `item/utils`, which is easy enough with `components/*/*.js` → `${dirname}/${filename}`
- `components/item/item.js` would ideally be simply `item` instead of `item/item`

I don't believe there is a generic way to do this at the moment. It seems like there could be two main ways to achieve this:
- some behaviour equivalent to regex backreferences in the pattern, for example `components/(*)/\\1.js`
- some sort of advanced logic in the label value, for example `${{filename == dirname ? dirname : dirname + '/' + filename}}`

Both of these options seem quite complicated extensions to the custom labels, but I think both of them could be quite useful beyond my own use case so could be worth considering.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250709,1

In the settings editor (GUI), searching for ""text editor"" causes all but four of the settings in the ""Text Editor"" category (positioned on the left of the window) to be displayed. This indicates that the search does not match against these cateogry headers, but filtering my those cateogries is often desirable.

Navigate to last edit location: work similar to Go back, but go to last editing code.
Navigate to next edit location: work similar to Go forward, but go to ahead editing code.

It's hard to make decisions about non-trivial requests when you're haunted by the possibility that only _after_ planning out your request and seeing the response starting to be generated, you see messages that Copilot wasn't provided with all of the available information because it would ""exceed the available context window size"" (paraphrasing). This kind of thing can literally be the difference between using Copilot Chat and _not even trying_ to use it for a lot of things. 

I'm not sure what form this should take but honestly, something that at least _estimates_ the predicted context window usage while you're preparing your request would be _really_ helpful. The current state of AI is very impressive, but as _developers_, we need more insight into what we're doing in the moment than the average AI user does, and we especially need transparency regarding the tools we're using, or they end up just wasting our time.

If, when we hit that ""send"" button, Copilot is going to then punish us for trying to be thorough, it makes it feel like a frustrating lucky dip, somewhat like how prompting feels with AI image and video generation. Type your prompt, hope for the right output. Fail. Adjust the prompt, try again. And again. And again. It doesn't have to be this way with Copilot if we could just get a bit more info to guide our decisions while we're composing all of the elements of the prompt _before_ we send it. If I can see well ahead of time that my choices are likely to be truncated, I'll adjust my approach along the way. And as a result, I'll start to build a strong mental model of where the approximate threshold for ""too much context"" begins, and that will help me take advantage of Copilot more readily because I'll feel less uncertainty at points where it occurs to me that maybe I could use Copilot for a given task.

Transparency. Always. Please.

Tell us what Copilot is doing and what it is likely to do, and err on the side of too much information, rather than not enough information.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/282772,1

Currently, the ""search.collapseResults"" setting controls whether global search results are expanded or collapsed by default. However, this setting does not affect the ""Find All Implementations"" or ""References"" panels, where results are always shown collapsed by default.

Proposal:
Please extend the functionality of the existing ""search.collapseResults"" setting so that it also applies to the ""Find All Implementations"" and ""References"" panels. This would provide a consistent experience across all result panels and improve usability for users who want results to always be expanded.

Use Case:
When working with large projects, having to manually expand each result group in the ""Find All Implementations"" or ""References"" panels can be tedious and time-consuming. Applying the existing setting to these panels would streamline navigation and improve productivity, without requiring a new setting.

Our organization is using Visual Studio Code, and we are concerned about the authentication features provided by extensions, such as Microsoft sign-in and GitHub sign-in.
We would like to restrict sign-in so that only accounts from our organization’s tenant (e.g., our Microsoft Entra ID or GitHub Enterprise organization) can be used, and prevent users from signing in with external/other-tenant accounts.
The reason is that if users can sign in with external accounts, they could upload local data from our organization-owned PCs to websites or clouds not managed by our organization, which is a security concern.
We have also tried to enforce this restriction using Intune, but it does not seem possible with the available policies.

This would improve code navigation by giving quick visual feedback on the user’s position in the file without requiring interaction with the minimap.

Why it matters:
	•	Helps with orientation in long files
	•	Maintains consistency across scroll methods
	•	A small UX improvement that could enhance workflow",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250241,1

Code reviews are a core part of modern software development, but they often happen outside the IDE in tools like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This forces developers to constantly context-switch between their code editor and browser-based review tools.

We propose a “Real-Time Code Review Mode” in VS Code that enables seamless, in-editor collaboration for code review, including:

Side-by-side diff view for pull requests or changesets

Inline comments, similar to GitHub PRs

Optional real-time co-editing (like Live Share)

Built-in voice and text chat for synchronous or asynchronous discussions

Why It’s Valuable:

🚫 Eliminates Context Switching: Developers can stay focused in VS Code without jumping between tabs to review code.

🧠 Enhances Code Quality: Reviewing in the editor allows for faster cross-referencing, better understanding, and smarter comments.

🤝 Improves Team Collaboration: Enables true pair programming or asynchronous feedback with real-time tools like chat or voice.

⏱ Saves Time: Developers can run code, debug, and review all in one place — significantly accelerating the review process.

Core Features Proposed:

 View PR diffs or staged changes in side-by-side format inside VS Code

 Leave inline review comments on lines of code (stored locally or synced to GitHub/GitLab)

 View, reply to, and resolve comments from others

 Enable co-editing or spectating mode with collaborators (build on Live Share)

 Optional voice or text chat directly tied to file or line context

 Sync with GitHub/GitLab comments and PR statuses

Future Enhancements (Optional):

🔗 Integration with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket for syncing PR comments and approvals

🧠 AI-assisted suggestions for comment replies or summarizing feedback

📂 Review session history & exportable summaries for audit trails

Environment:

VS Code version: [e.g., 1.89.0]

Platforms: Windows/macOS/Linux

Git provider: [e.g., GitHub]

Extensions: Live Share (optional dependency)

Related Features & References:

[VS Code Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) – supports co-editing but lacks review workflows

[GitHub Pull Requests Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) – good start, but lacks real-time collaboration and inline chat

Conclusion:
This feature would make VS Code a true one-stop development platform by deeply integrating collaborative code review. It blends the best of GitHub PRs, Google Docs-style editing, and Live Share, elevating team productivity and code quality.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250203,1

### The problem

When a running extension is disabled from the View->Extensions view, a Restart Extensions button is shown to notify the user that the Extensions must be restarted to disable running extensions.

But when an extension is disabled from the Running Extensions view, this Restart Extensions button is not shown.

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Go to View->Extensions.
2.  In the Extensions view go to the Views and More Actions menu by clicking on the three dots (...)  in the top right corner of the Extension view.
3. Click on Show Running Extensions
4. Hide the Extensions view by going to the View->Explorer view
5. Go to the Running Extensions view
6. Right click on a running extension and click Disable
7. Notice that the extension is still running and there is no indication that the extensions need to be restarted.

### Proposed solution 1

Copy the behavior of the View->Extenions view and show a Reload Extensions button when an extension is disabled from the Running Extensions View.

### Proposed solution 2

Why is there a separate Running Extensions view in the first place? It only shows the running extensions, and their activation time. There is no separate view for installed, disabled, outdated or populair extensions. These are shown by an ""@""filter in the extension search box. I propose to create an @<!-->running filter in the View->Extensions view and remove the Running Extensions view at all. It adds no value, creates this bug, and could create new bugs in the future when new behavior is added to the View->Extensions view and this behavior is not copied to the Running Extensions view, which is the cause of this bug.

When this solution is implemented, the 2 ways for viewing the Running Extensions need to be updated as well:
1. the Show Running Extensions option from step 3 of the reproduction steps above.
2. command ""Developer: Show Running Extensions"" from the command palette",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/250201,1
3105607741,Feature Request: Add Timestamps to Chat History,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

## Feature Request: Add Timestamps to Chat History

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, GitHub Copilot saves chat history, but users cannot see when each question was asked or when responses were provided. This makes it difficult to track conversation timing and reference previous discussions chronologically.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add timestamp display for both user questions and Copilot responses in the chat history interface. The timestamps should show the date and time when each message was sent/received.

**Benefits:**
- Improved user experience when reviewing past conversations
- Better context for understanding conversation flow
- Easier reference to specific discussions by time
- Enhanced debugging and productivity tracking capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Display timestamps for all messages in chat history
- Show both date and time in a user-friendly format
- Maintain consistent timestamp formatting across the interface
- Ensure timestamps are displayed in the user's local timezone

- Auto-redirect back to VS Code (which may be the nicest, but it does have the above confirmation)
- Redirecting to a localhost server which doesn't bring you back to VS Code but lands you on a page that says something to the effect of ""you can close this tab""
- The device code flow 

We could run an experiment to make the redirect to local host the default and compare the drop off rate to the auto-redirect.

We could look to still use the protocol link to open VS Code from that localhost page, so we would get the best of 2 worlds:
- sign-in completes in all cases and will never hang

I have dozens of tabs open for any of my projects, but they are utterly disorganized.  Please provide an option to open tabs in alphabetical order.  Right now, when you open a file in a new tab, it is appended to the end of the tab bar.  Rather than that, could you position it in the tab bar alphabetically? If the user drags a tab closer to another tab, that's fine; allow it.  If the user then opens another file, open it in the same alphabetical order as the initially maintained files (not the moved one).  It shouldn't be hard to implement.

Hi, as a dev working with large project and saving a lot of work with stashes to submit on more convenient time, 
I wish I could easier recognize where and how many stashes I currently have, for instance when I check for existing stashes with VSCode command  `> Git: View Stash` .

I would like for instance to be informed on listing stage, that each present repo has particular number of stashes, also zero if none present. Possibly printing stash names -if user provided such - would be very handful.
It would be very useful to know this **before I enter each repo** , to know this earlier and avoid entering each one.

For comparison, when I type in terminal 'git stash list', I get output like:
```git
stash@{0}: On (no branch): bugVisibleOptions
stash@{1}: On (no branch): ....
```
I attach a screenshot, in my project the list was much bigger and troublesome to check each manually
You see here the sub-module's repo name and current head, but when checking stashes it isn't very relevant.

Could you please improve the information provided by VS Code?

Summarizing some discussions surrounding the language model provider API and efforts to finalize it

The idea is to accomplish the following goals
1. Allow extensions to contribute language models
2. Allow users to manage which models appear in the model picker
3. Allow extensions to have custom flows for auth and additioanl model configuration such as Azure Open AI


To complete finalization we should modify the contribution point from

```
		""languageModels"": [
			{
				""vendor"": ""gemini""
			},
		]
```

To something like 

```
		""languageModels"": [
			{
				""vendor"": ""gemini"",
                                 ""displayName"": ""Google Gemini""
			},
		]
```


Additionally, we need a way to have a sort of provider provider for the language model lists. The current suggested shape is to follow `CallHierarchyProvider` and expose a list of language model items that then get passed back to the provide response function

So, I would like to suggest a few improvements to it.

- Could you add a way to add / remove `extensions` from each profile list, per choice basis, through the profiles view?
  - It should auto complete if adding extensions to the list, in a input. With the name and identifier. e.g., `rust-analyzer - rust-lang.rust-analyzer` or just the name with a pointer to the ext itself.
  - It should have a `x` button to remove the ones you do not want.

I would like the ability to set custom editor split ratios in VS Code, such as 60% / 40% or any other configurable percentage. Currently, splits are only adjustable manually by dragging, and VS Code does not persist the size between sessions.

This feature is especially useful for users working with dual-monitor setups or when needing precise control over editor pane sizes.

Additionally, when using multiple monitors and keeping the sidebar open, the sidebar causes the editor groups to be misaligned across the monitors, making it difficult to achieve a proper centered split. The ability to compensate for or configure sidebar width or have the split respect physical monitor boundaries would improve usability in such setups.

Copilot should visually preview what the result of a suggested git command would do. For example, if Copilot suggests a command like  `git add . && git commit -m ""init"", it could show that it's going to stage the file and commit it with the message being ""init"".
Maybe show the source controll tab before and after.

Motivation:

    Prevent accidental data loss or confusion from running destructive or complex git commands.
    Help users (especially those new to git) gain a better understanding of what each command will do.
    Improve trust and safety when using Copilot’s CLI suggestions.

Potential Implementation Ideas:

    Show a graphical branch diagram preview for commands that affect branch history.
    Show a diff summary for commands that modify files/index.
    Provide a natural language summary of the command’s effect.
    Integrate with VS Code’s existing git UI where possible.

<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
In VSCode, the double-click selection does not respect the configured `editor.wordSeparators`.  
I tested it on two environment: plain text with no extensions loaded and PHP editor with the PHP Intelephense extension.

I removed from the default settings.json `editor.wordSeparators` these characters: dollar sign, dash, quotes, double quotes, tick, equal, underline:

```json
{
   ""editor.wordSeparators"": ""~!@#%^&*()-+[{]}\\\\|;:,.<>/?""
}
```

This is a sample script:

```php
const CONSTANT_VALUE = ""some value"";
self::$_instance = new self();
```

If I double click on word ***some***, the selection expand to include opening double quotes ***""some***, and the same does when double click on ***value*** including ending double quotes ***value""***.
The desired behaviour should select only text because I removed double quotes from `wordSeparators.
Please note that also on that web editor page, the selection is correct and when double click ***some*** it will not include the opening double quotes.

If I navigate or select text with keyboard (`ctrl+right` or `ctrl+shift+right`), after ***_VALUE*** the cursor will skip equal sign and opening double quotes and go directly to the end of ***""some*** text.
On that situation, the navigation to next word (usually `ctrl+right` shortcut) will stop at the end of word, not the beginning on the next word.
On all editors I use, commercial or free, the skip next word command will move to the begin of the next word, not to the last char of the same word. If this can be configured with that option, it will be great.
The desired behaviour should move or select up to the beginning or the next word, not including symbols defined on configuration.

Can these behaviours be changed with options or extensions?
My suggestion is to use the already defined and perfect named `editor.wordSeparators` variable and respect it on all cursor navigations and selections conditions.

I read many issues opened and closed, I hope this will not be a duplicate request.

**NOTE**: 
I set this as a feature request, but in my situations this is considered as a bug because all other editors work in a different way.

I'd like to request an enhancement for the editor's replace widget (invoked by ""Edit"" -> ""Replace"" or Shift+Cmd+F).

Current Behavior: The replace widget opens with a default width. While it can be manually resized to the full editor width, this adjusted width is not saved across sessions. Upon restarting VS Code, the widget reverts to its original, narrower width.

Desired Behavior: I propose one of the following solutions:

An option for the replace widget to automatically adapt to the full width of the active editor upon opening.
Alternatively, the manually adjusted width of the replace widget should be persisted across VS Code sessions, reopening with the last used width.
Reasoning: For users who frequently work with long lines of code or prefer a broader view for find and replace operations, repeatedly resizing the replace widget is inefficient. Persisting the width or providing a full-width option would significantly improve workflow and user experience.

Thank you for considering this feature.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/249723,1

There have been many times when breezing through a session with Agent mode that I'll miss the fact that a critical constant / variable or URL is subtly changed without realizing it. The code will still ""work"", but it will always cause issues later down the road that are really really hard to trace/debug.

Currently there's no way to configure ""indent as you type"" rules to match your preferred style.  There are quite a few recognized common styles (eg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style) and precisely matching all of them might be outside the scope of VScode, and better suited for a extension. But the biggest differentiation between those styles comes down to whether opening and or closing brackets are indented to match the code block. Offering a check box option for ""indent opening bracket"" and an separate one for ""indent closing bracket"" would go a long ways towards supporting developer choice.  Right now developer choice comes down to using Jetbrains instead which offers nearly infinite customization on this regard, but has gone too far down that path with 100+ settings for auto-styling. 

The current vscode style (Allman) would have both of those check boxes unchecked for c-like languages. Whitesmiths would have both checked.  By only checking one  or the other of those boxes, K&R and Ratliff would be supported.  ",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/249557,1

Hi VS Code Team,

I'm writing to propose a feature request regarding the native Settings Sync functionality.

Problem:
Currently, when Settings Sync is active, it's not immediately obvious to the user which specific Microsoft or GitHub account is currently being used for synchronization. While the ""Accounts"" icon in the Activity Bar indicates that an account is logged in, and clicking it allows for account management, it doesn't prominently display the active sync account (e.g., username or email) at a glance.

Users who manage multiple personal and work accounts (both GitHub and Microsoft) or simply want to quickly confirm their sync status might find it cumbersome to verify which account is active. They might have to rely on memory or dig into the Output channels to confirm.

Proposed Solution / Suggestion:
I suggest enhancing the user interface to provide a quicker way for users to see the active Settings Sync account. Here are a few ideas:

Example:

Change the existing menu item Settings Sync is On to:
`Settings Sync is On (GitHub: example@gmail.com)`

or
`Settings Sync is On (Microsoft: your_email@outlook.com)`

When developing, I like to use the ""error"" problem level for compiler errors, ""warning"" for linter errors, and ""info"" for linter warnings. However, sometimes I overlook ""info"" diagnostics, leading to CI errors (because I use warnings-as-errors, otherwise warnings are just noise).
It'd be nice to be able to override the severity reported.

3078049949,Standardized Rules Format (AGENTS.md),"A number of us (VSC included) need some kind of context (""rules"") defined per-codebase. This is often used to indicate the ways you should write code, the technologies you use.. generally speaking its a mix of preference and knowledge.

Today these rules exist in various fashion, but here are some known patterns:

- a rules directory (e.g. .cursor/rules/)
- settings dialog (e.g. Sentry's solution uses this)
- llms.txt or similar (agents.md is another example)

Formats I've seen:

- markdown + headers, where headers usually indicate how the rule might be applied
- undefined text

Its important that the core of this is reusable so developers dont need to reimplement these context providers in multiple formats, let alone in formats outside of the version control system. I do believe a single file is the wrong solution, as we shouldnt require these context files be only functional with RAG or large context windows. Having basic indicators in the format (e.g. this applies to this glob) is extremely helpful.

I'm going to leave it up to others to provide feedback who have more knowledge in the space, but I'm representing Sentry's concerns here. One point of inspiration Sentry has talked about is the OWNERS file constructs, and how its become a bit of a standard over time (albeit with a GitHub flavored addition).",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/249387,1

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

Currently, VS Code only supports a single command to launch an MCP server.
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_configuration-format

It would be great if the server JSON object supported a `commands` property, instead of a single `command` + `args` + `env` + `envFile`. This would allow a setup command first, and then a start command after.

For a .NET based MCP server, this could look:

```json
{
  ""mcp"": {
    ""servers"": {
      ""my-mcp-server"": {
        ""type"": ""stdio"",
        ""commands"": [
          {
            ""command"": ""dotnet"",
            ""args"": [ ""tool"", ""install"", ""--global"", ""Knapcode.PirateMcp"", ""--version"", ""2.0.0"" ]
          },
          { 
            ""command"": ""piratemcp"", // should not need PATH reloaded, global tools go to an existing PATH dir
            ""args"": [ ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This would also allow `npx` (or similar) commands to separate the setup from the install command to provide a better UI or debugging experience.

As in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/86275, already closed but I'm trying to reactivate, it would great to have the ability to group what you have activated and visible in the activity bar. For example, you can be working in a project involving different technologies and processes and you are using different bunch of extensions in the same project for different tasks and you want to have related extensions grouped in the activity bar view to access then properly but avoiding the need to go to the overlay area using the three dots.

3077273015,Should `vscode.executeInlayHintProvider` gain `itemResolveCount` as an argument?,"API commands like `vscode.executeCodeActionProvider` and `vscode.executeCompletionItemProvider` have an `itemResolveCount` argument:

This is used to do the 2nd half of these LSP language features, where you sometimes need to ""resolve"" the items in a more expensive way.

I noticed that `vscode.executeInlayHintProvider` does not have this argument, meaning that the Inlay Hint Resolve bit can't be called in the same way:
https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#inlayHint_resolve

Would it make sense to add `itemResolveCount` to `vscode.executeInlayHintProvider` to support this? Or maybe some other hook like `vscode.resolveInlayHintProvider`?

I assume this might be somewhat hard to do performantly in `vscode.executeInlayHintProvider` itself, because you probably want to show a lot of inlay hints but only resolve one when the user double clicks on it to retrieve delayed `textEdits`.",feature-request,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/249359,1

## Description

When copying and pasting messages that include an attached context tag, the tag becomes inactive (greyed out). This forces users to manually re‑activate or re‑type the tag wrapper each time they paste content.

## Proposal

* Keep the context tag in its active (blue) state when copying and pasting messages.
* Alternatively, allow completing or canceling a draft and then editing the prompt—so users can re-enable or modify tags without manual work.

## Expected Behavior

* Pasted context tags remain editable and active.
* Users can duplicate or move content with tags intact, saving time and reducing friction.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. In Copilot Chat, add a context tag (e.g. `@context …`) and type a message.
2. Copy the tagged message.
3. Paste into the chat input.
4. Observe that the tag appears inactive (greyed out) and cannot be edited without removing and re‑adding it.

## Additional Notes

* A “Retry” or “Edit Tag” action on failed prompts could also streamline recovery.
* Highly valuable for workflows that reuse common prompts or templates.

## Terminologies

## Problem
Currently, VS Code loads extensions indiscriminately on startup or workspace load, which can:
- Slow down performance when many extensions activate unnecessarily.
- Cause unwanted behavior in certain project contexts (e.g., Python extensions interfering with Rust projects).
- Lack prioritization for critical extensions in large workspaces.

## Proposed Solution
Introduce extension load control through either:
- **Option 1**: `tasks.json` Configuration
```json
{
  ""version"": ""2.0.0"",
  ""extensionControl"": {
    ""startup"": [""ms-python.python"", ""rust-lang.rust-analyzer""],
    ""taskSpecific"": {
      ""build"": [""ms-vscode.cmake-tools""],
      ""test"": [""hbenl.vscode-test-explorer""]
    }
  }
}
```
- **Option 2**: GUI Toggle (Command Palette + Status Bar)

  - Command: Extensions: Configure Startup Extensions → Opens a multi-select UI.
  - Status Bar Indicator: Click to enable/disable extensions for the current session.

## Benefits
- **Performance:** Faster startup by delaying non-critical extensions.
- **Context-awareness:** Load only relevant extensions per task/project.
- **User Control:** Override defaults without uninstalling extensions.

117679274,Unsaved files should be preserved on quit (hot exit),"Mac OSX 10.10.5 Yosemite, VS Code 0.10.1

Modern apps have a convention of not losing changes when the application quits and files haven't been explicitly saved. Sublime Text is particularly nice in this regard, where newly created or unsaved files are silently preserved on quit and restored when it is launched again. This would be nice for VS Code to support as well.

**To Reproduce**
1. Make changes to a file, or create a brand new unsaved file
2. Quit VS Code

**Desired Behavior**

VS Code immediately quits with no prompt. After relaunching the changed file is restored with changes intact and an unsaved indicator.

**Actual Behavior**

VS Code prompts you to save the file or discard your changes.

I use VS Code daily at work and at home since the very first preview release and I love it.

I do have a major concern though about the way the differents files are shown in the 'Working Folder' view : they're all formatted in the same, plain way, and it is actually quite hard to distinguish what is what when looking at it (especially folders vs files). In a previous release, I recall the folder names were bold. It was better but nonetheless not enough.

I think this image below can describe pretty well what I suggest:

The same solution is opened in both Code and full VS, and obviously the latter works way better with icons and varying font weight.

Would it be possible to achieve a similar look with Code ? I don't know about reusing the full VS assets since it might be a problem with licensing and stuff though. I gave a look at the new extension API but it specifically states that it doesn't allow for DOM manipulation, so I guess it's a no-go.

If it's not in the priorities of the dev team (I understand there are way more important stuff to work on in the short term), would you accept a PR that would bring such a feature ?

117825941,API: Extra events like onPreSaveTextDocument?,"It would be nice to have some extra events I guess. The first one I can think of is `onPreSaveTextDocument` (or `onSaveTextDocument`). One that will be invoked right before the document gets saved.
### Use Cases

The first one I can think of is my own plugin [final-newline](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/vscode-final-newline) that will insert a final newline at the end of the file when the user saves the document. At the moment it is implemented like this: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> → `Save` → `Insert newline` (if necessary) → `Save`
That last save triggers a new iteration of my plugin which will detect a final newline is already present and will stop the execution. So my loop is triggered twice because the plugin is triggered after the document was saved instead of before.

I think there will be other file manipulation plugins that want to manipulate the file before it gets saved as well.

From Alex:

I agree some sort of onBeforeSave action is indeed needed, we just need more thinking regarding how to expose this without causing any data loss. If we block the save to wait on extensions, I can imagine it possible that the wait could be indefinite, resulting in data loss. Maybe a time ceiling of 10s, after which the file gets saved...

118464809,Breaking vscode into modules,"It's really great to see vscode's source released! 

I've been look at your implementation of git and given the extensiveness of it, I was wondering if it could be a great, general purpose git wrapper around the CLI. 

I spent a little bit of time trying to see what would be involved in extracting it into an npm module compiled into JavaScript (bear in mind I've never used typescript).

I ran into quite a few challenging problems:

1) typescript and module paths - it looks as if typescript handles modules very differently than node, brunch, webpack, ES6, etc. I've never used typescript before, but maybe they have some sort of global paths rather than relative paths or perhaps this was a choice by the vscode team? Ideally, all of the git implementation would be self-referencing using relative paths and depend on the smallest number of shared modules as needed using absolute paths to the node_modules folders / modules.

2) cross-dependencies into the vs directory - it looks like vscode was written in a semi-monolithic, but nicely grouped way rather than as many smaller modules. Ideally, there would be a separation between client, common, and node logic around smaller aspects rather than through the big `platform` and `workbench` buckets to reduce cross-dependencies and to promote reuse. When I'm trying to only compile an entry point through common/git/git.ts, it seems to be pulling in `vs/base/browser/keyboardEvent.ts` but I cannot figure out where the dependency is from (I'm new to typescript so not sure how to do dependency tracing).

These two aspects of code structure makes it difficult to separate the git functionality from all of the application logic so I'm putting aside this idea for now; however....I was wondering if there any plans to break up vscode into smaller, reusable modules using npm like Atom did?

Obviously, it is still early days for open sourcing vscode and I'm sure there are a lot of other things on your roadmap, but this would be a great longer-term goal!

For Vim emulation, there needs to be a way to capture key strokes and suppress them before they are inserted in the buffer. That is, normal mode in Vim.

In other editors, it's a problem that all key bindings work by default in normal mode. Because plugins are loaded alphabetically, there is then a chance that the plugin to load last may override Vim key bindings, even though that plugin isn't interested in normal mode at all and/or doesn't even work when the editor is in normal mode.

When VS Code enables a variant of normal mode (when? :-)), I think it'd be best if key bindings had to opt-in explicitly to normal mode.

Is there a _correct way_ to replace core commands?

My intention is to create an extension to replace _Edit / Copy (`editor.action.clipboardCopyAction`)_ and _Edit / Cut (`editor.action.clipboardCutAction`)_ commands. So, when there is no selection, the _Copy/Cut_ would use the _current word_ instead of the _entire line_.

About coding, I can:
- Determine the word based on the cursor position
- Select the word
- Execute `vscode.commands.executeCommand(""editor.action.clipboardCopyAction"")` 
- Remove the selection, returning the cursor to its initial position.

But I was wondering if there is something else that I could (or couldn't) do, like defining the `keybindings` in `package.json` to `Ctrl + C / Ctrl + X`; or define `vscode.commands.registerCommand` for the core command, with my own code.

118898021,API: No way to find out that an editor has closed,"For the VS Code API tests I have a clean up function that signals that it is done when all editors are closed.

The issue is that the `window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` event is not good enough for testing on the visible text editors as shown by the following test:

```
test('visibleTextEditors', () => {
    return workspace.openTextDocument(join(workspace.rootPath, './far.js')).then(doc => {
        return window.showTextDocument(doc).then((editor) => {
            return new Promise((c, e) => {
                const listener = window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor(d => {
                    console.log('editor is null?: ' + !d);
                    if (window.visibleTextEditors.length > 0) {
                        console.log('visibleTextEditors count is: ' + window.visibleTextEditors.length);
                        return;
                    }

                    c();
                });

            });
        });
    });
});
```

The value passed in from the event is null as expected because I am running the close all editors action. However, `window.visibleTextEditors.length` is still 1 at that point.

This issue has lost focus and turned into a discussion whether VS Code should provide PHP support out of box.

119075258,It is difficult to deal with keybindings when using non-US standard keyboard layout,"Reference: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85)

In the UI and in the `keybindings.json` file, VSCode represents OEM key codes using the US standard keyboard:
- `VK_OEM_1` (0xBA) as `;`
- `VK_OEM_PLUS` (0xBB) as `=`
- `VK_OEM_COMMA` (0xBC) as `,`
- `VK_OEM_MINUS` (0xBD) as `-`
- `VK_OEM_PERIOD` (0xBE) as `.`
- `VK_OEM_2` (0xBF) as `/`
- `VK_OEM_3` (0xC0) as `
- `VK_OEM_4` (0xDB) as `[`
- `VK_OEM_5` (0xDC) as `\\`
- `VK_OEM_6` (0xDD) as `]`
- `VK_OEM_7` (0xDE) as `'`

---

**This means when VSCode renders in the UI a keybinding as `Ctrl+/`, it actually means `Ctrl+VK_OEM_2`.** 
- When using a US standard layout, `VK_OEM_2` is physically labeled as `/?` and sits next to the right hand side `Shift`, but 
- when using a Swiss German keyboard layout, for example, `VK_OEM_2` is physically labeled as `§°` and sits next to `1`.

---

This makes life **quite difficult** for us who use non-US standard keyboard layouts (I'm using a Swiss German keyboard on my laptop).

---

The only way to make this experience great for non-US standard keyboards is to be able to read the current set keyboard layout from the OS and then:
- render these OEM key codes in the UI according to the configured keyboard layout.
- register multiple default keybindings per action and per keyboard layout.
-  **AFAIK, at this time, this is not possible in electron**.

---

In the short term, **I would like to ask passionate non US standard keyboard layout developers to create and publish extensions** that overwrite the default VSCode keybindings with keyboard layout optimized variants. Such an extension is super easy to author, it would only consist of a `package.json` that [contributes keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributeskeybindings)

---

**Update 30.11.2015**: Electron renders the keybindings correctly in the native menu, now it is a question if it will provide API for the JavaScript side to do so too:

Under German (Switzerland), `Split Editor` gets correctly rendered in the menu as `Ctrl+ä`:

   ""_end"": {

119762581,User configurable maximum *.d.ts file-size,"I stumbled over an issue where really large TypeScript .d.ts-files were not parsed correctly in JavaScript mode.

After some debugging I found out that the reason is a hard-coded file-size limit, where all characters in file-strings that are longer than 1,500,000 characters are getting replaced by space-characters and therefore getting ignored. This happens in **languages/typescript/common/project/snapshots.ts**:

```
export function fromValue(value: string): ts.IScriptSnapshot {

    var len = value.length;
    if (len > 1500000) {
        // everything except newline characters will be replaced
        // with whitespace. this ensures a small syntax tree and
        // no symbol information overkill. keeping the newline
        // characters makes further processing (based on line and
        // column) easy for us
        value = value.replace(/[^\\r\\n]/g, ' ');
    }

    return {
        getLength: () => len,
        getText: value.substring.bind(value),
        getChangeRange: () => null
    };
}
```

My idea was to make this maximum file size user-configurable using the `workbench/node/UserSettings` class. However, this is not possible as `typeScriptWorker2` runs in the `common` environment and has therefore no access to the `fs` and `path` module.

So another suggestion is to just increase the maximum file size (or omit the check completely). I removed the length check and tested the editor with a *.d.ts-file with ~8,000,000 characters. I could not perceive any lags or unresponsiveness. The code completion still worked smoothly. Neither did the memory usage significantly increase.

In addition, the languages/typescript/common/lib/lib.es6.d.ts-file, which defines the standard language, itself is 1,470,724 characters long. So there are only ~30,000 characters left for future changes, which could lead to a bug that will probably be hard to track down.

Is there a quick and easy method to make the maximum file-size user configurable?
If not, my suggestion is to increase the hard-coded maximum file-size to at least 10,000,000 characters.
In the future, when the JavaScript mode will also be moved to an extension, it would be sensible to make the maximum file size user configurable.

When writing a JavaScript for loop a common pattern is 
- type 'foo' and chose the for loop template
- the template comes up with the complete structure and suggests ""index"" as the name of the loop variable.  
- 'i' is a common loop variable name.  If the user types i to replace index, the code completion engine suggests the 'if' control structure. 
- of course, if you hit enter that inserts an if structure in the middle of the first line of the for loop 
- if you hit any other key to dismiss the 'if' suggestion, that punts you out of the template completion and you have to manually change all of the array names, etc.

The template completion needs more context to know that a variable name is being entered so a control structure is not a good suggestion.

When doing a search in this repo for `text.html.basic` I get several other syntaxes that reference it. If I try using those languages with an html or dust file, it doesn't highlight the html. If I change the language to html, everything highlights as expected.

Not necessarily for ""debugging"" purposes, but for a more consistent and extended user experience exchange for ongoing for **user input creation**, then **VS Code output consumption**, followed by more **user input creation**, ... so on and so forth.

At the moment, the `showInputBox()` functionality with the output channel can seem like a one-time exchange, without the continuity of a input/output console (like the debugger console).

121962151,[css] Evaluate the 2 browser rule for CSS auto-complete,"(sorry for long post)

As per #806 (for HTML), in CSS Intellisense a feature will only show up if there are two implementations. Unlike HTML this is controlled by the build script that excludes features with 1 or zero implementations.

The problem with this:
- all webkit prefixed features show up due to Chrome + Opera  (+ Safari for older features when Chrome and Safari were both using WebKit).
- the above is also the case for unprefixed features added to blink and picked up by both Chrome + Opera
- No moz prefixed features will ever show up as no other browser uses -moz-
- No ms prefixed features are included. This has changed in the latest update to the data in my PR as Edge supports a number of the same -ms- prefixes, but there are some it doesn't support or will drop, and any new feature added to Edge will show up ad IE isn't adding new features. In theory there will be no new MS prefixes as we now use flags, but it isn't impossible a prefix may need to be used. Features like the ms prefixed flex box are useful even though only implemented by IE10, as they're needed for backwards compat, and ofter difficult to remember due to the different syntax (syntax was updated just after IE10 shipped)
- Unlike with Chrome/Opera, any unprefixed feature added Edge, Safari or Firefox will not show until another browser picks it up.
- Unprefixed features will not show up when only prefixed ones are supported. This is bad as it leads devs to only use the -webkit- (or whichever) version, leading to interop issues for other browsers. We had to implement various webkit prefixes in Edge for this reason. The linter does complain when the unprefixed version is not used (at least for some properties…I've not tried all) but they're not included in the auto-complete. Flex box is a good example of where VS Code was only recommending -webkit- with the old syntax (now fixed with latest data update as browsers beyond IE now support unprefixed latest syntax). 

It will be much more difficult to codify in the generator, but there should either be some smarts built in to consider all the prefixed and unprefixed implementations as the same feature, so that if -moz- is supported by firefox and unprefixed by Edge for example, that is two implementations. It should also include the unprefixed one even if there are no implementations to help avoid vendor lock-in. The main issue I see is how to associate features that have different syntax, like how the flex box properties and values are different between old webkit/moz syntax, mid IE 10 syntax and the final unprefixed syntax.

If the rule is to stay at two implementations then Chrome and Opera should be treated as one in the generator. Safari too for older features, but that may be harder to add. Edge and IE should probably be counted as one too.

OR it could be made more simple and include if one implementation exists. This will be more fair and useful than the current situation, but it still falls foul of the fact unprefixed features will not show up for features only using prefixes in current browsers.

   a. The watch task re-runs checks for just `foo.js`.
   b. The problem matcher notices that a re-run has occurred, and blows away all problems of that type
   c. Only problems for `foo.js` are listed, even though `bar.js` still has issues.

I'd like to avoid building a language server or plugin for this if I can (the watch task is very useful to non VS code users on the team; and problem matchers are wonderfully simple).

Or maybe we could have an option for only clearing problems for files that have changed (or that match a particular expression?)

122685899,Hooks to improve the debugger for compile-to-js languages?,"I'm working on a compile-to-js language called [Skew](http://www.skew-lang.org/). Visual Studio Code's language services API has been really awesome so far and I'm impressed how easy it was to hook up my compiler to provide standard features like tooltips and diagnostics and so on. I tried to do the same thing in Atom and ended up needing to implement tooltips and squiggly underlines and stuff which was a bummer. So great job on the API!

Right now the primary target language for the Skew compiler is JavaScript, so it makes sense to run Skew code with the node debugger target. I recently discovered that the debugger supports source maps so I'd like to focus on making Visual Studio Code the primary IDE for Skew. However, Skew is different enough from JavaScript that the values in the debugger panel don't make sense sometimes and the value tooltips often don't work. Some examples: the object context is called ""self"" instead of ""this"", enums show up as numbers instead of their textual names, function names in the call stack use their rewritten names instead of their original names.

Is there a way to hook into the view layer of the debugger to provide better names, tooltips, and value visualizations for languages that compile to JavaScript? The debugger API seems to be at the wrong level. I want to leverage the existing node debugger, just change the view layer when the current file is Skew code. Doing this customization in the view layer also seems like the right place to me because it means debugging a project that uses multiple compile-to-js languages would be able to work. Other languages could benefit too. For example, tooltips currently don't work when debugging CoffeeScript for variables that use the ""@"" prefix to access instance variables.

122754604,Allow editor commands to be registered in extension code without adding to package.json,"I've got an idea to allow extra extensibility of VS Code using PowerShell via my extension.  Here's a proposal that I wrote up with some initial ideas:

https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/81

The core requirement for my extensibility model is to be able to add new commands to VS Code after my extension has already loaded, without also having to add them to my package.json.  This will allow my users to write new actions, analyzers, and code formatters which they could invoke using VS Code's great keybinding system.

Currently the API lets you register the ID of the command and the function to be called.  If we could also get parameters for the display name and category of the command it should be enough to accomplish full dynamic command registration.  As a bonus it would nice to have a parameter for registering a default key binding for the command, but it's OK if that comes later.

I realize that there's probably a reason why you'd prefer to have commands be registered in package.json rather than completely in code.  My guess is that it allows the commands to be displayed before the extension is fully loaded.  The dynamic commands I'd like to have wouldn't need to be displayed until the extension is fully loaded anyway, so this doesn't matter as much to me.

Thanks for considering this!

UAC asks for permissions and a new Code window opens, but it is not elevated, when I save it says permission denied. I have to close my project before I can get an elevated Code instance.

I don't know if that is a restriction of Windows but seeing that you can, for example, run a normal Powershell and an elevated Powershell side-by-side I think this should be possible. The optimal case of course would be if Code could elevate itself if it can't save a file because of insufficient permissions. But being able to run elevated and non-elevated side-by-side would already help a lot.

One issue I'm having (OSX El Capitan) is that VSCode doesn't seem to recognize some of the system wide services keyboard shortcuts I've set up to work with text from any application.

I have some System Services that run scripts, which I activate via a mouse menu, and those work fine.  I have others that I activate via the keyboard. For example, I have a System Service to take selected text and use a shell script to append it to a special file.  I have a mouse menu item that invokes that service via the the keyboard shortcut I've defined:  Cmd-Shift-Alt-Ctrl-A.  This works just fine, but I cannot invoke the same service using the actual keys on the keyboard.

All the shortcuts I'm using have  Cmd-Shift-Alt-Ctrl as the modifiers, so I don't think there are any conflicts with existing keyboard shortcuts.  Other system wide keyboard shortcuts do work, so I'm not sure what the issue is with these particular, OSX System Services related ones.  Is it a problem with the modifiers, or is there some issue currently with OSX system services support?

124276673,Debugger API for extensions needs to support selection of 32-bit or 64-bit debug host,"In working on the PowerShell extension, we need to allow users to be able to choose whether to launch a 32-bit or a 64-bit debug host.  Certain PowerShell modules will only load into one or the other.

I see that there is support for different `program:` settings per OS:

``` json
""debuggers"": [{
    ""type"": ""gdb"",
    ""windows"": {
        ""program"": ""./bin/gdbDebug.exe"",
    },
```

What I would like to see is `windows` remain as ""use the default OS architecture"" and you add `windows (x86)` to allow extension developers to specify a different, x86 host exe on 64-bit Windows e.g.: 

``` json
""debuggers"": [{
    ""type"": ""gdb"",
    ""windows"": {
        ""program"": ""./bin/gdbDebug.exe"",
    },
    ""windows (x86)"": {
        ""program"": ""./bin/gdbDebug.x86.exe"",
    },
```

Ideally, on a 32-bit system, the use of `windows (x86)` would never appear to the end user just as `linux` or `osx` would not appear as debug targets.  However on 64-bit Windows the user would need to be able to select between the 64-bit debug host and the 32-bit (x86) debug host.  I'm not sure what the ""UI"" would be for this.  

One option is that we just add another debugger intialConfiguration. So for the PowerShell extension, we would have:

``` json
""initialConfigurations"": [
    {
        ""name"": ""PowerShell"",
        ""type"": ""PowerShell"",
        ""request"": ""launch"",
        ""program"": ""${file}""
    },
    {
        ""name"": ""PowerShell (x86)"",
        ""type"": ""PowerShell"",
        ""request"": ""launch"",
        ""program"": ""${file}""
    }                    
]
```

The problem is that with this approach - using `windows` and `windows (x86)` to distinguish between host architectures - is that the `type:` setting would not be any different. Both hosts would be defined under `type: ""PowerShell""`.  I'm not familiar enough with the debugger section of the package.json format to figure this out.  

I could create two different debugger sections, one type `PowerShell` and the other type `PowerShell (x86)`.  However that forces a one time choice when the launch.json file gets configured and that doesn't seem right.  The user is likely going to want to switch between OS native and x86 depending on the script they are debugging.

Another option, would require smarts in the Debug viewlet's toolbar dropdown.  It would recognize both `windows` and `windows (x86)` and take a single ""name"" e.g.:

``` json
""initialConfigurations"": [
    {
        ""name"": ""PowerShell"",
        ""type"": ""PowerShell"",
        ""request"": ""launch"",
        ""program"": ""${file}""
    }             
]
```

... and create two entries in the dropdown: `PowerShell` and `PowerShell (x86)`.  Hmm, not sure I like that option myself.

Another option is to allow the initialConfigurations sections to specify `programArgs:` to the launched program. Then we could write a small CMD file to take the args and launch the correct debug host exe.  That we can create `PowerShell` and `PowerShell (x86)` named configurations that will automatically show up in the Debuggers' debug target dropdown list.  

Or another option is to have an initialConfiguration section property that would allow the selection of `windows` or `windows (x86)`.

124348676,Enable specifying installation directories in npm.sh,"Hello,

Currently you are unable to specify installation paths for node modules used by Code via `scripts/npm.sh`, only the architecture. This is an issue for package management systems on Linux where specific packages may ""own"" a set of files or directories, and thus produces conflicts on the system when multiple packages attempt to own the same set of files.

I'm proposing the following options be added to `npm.sh`:

`--installdir=DIR`: This would enable you to specify a general installation directory:
- Beneficial for build systems that use isolated install directories (where the contents of it are then considered the contents of a binary package) away from the build directories.

`--node-modules=DIR`: This would enable you to specify **the root** of where you want node modules to be installed.
- Resolves potential file conflicts for packages and pollution of global node_modules.

Examples:

`--installdir=/var/ypkg-root/install/vscode/`: This would be the root of the file system. Installation of binaries such as those placed in `/usr/bin` would begin with the installdir, so it is conceivable that the directory would for the binaries would then be `/var/ypkg-root/install/vscode/usr/bin`.
- Note: This would only be on the isolated build system, the final contents installed on the user's system would still be /usr/bin, this would just specify where to install things on build-time.
- Defaults to `/`
- Sets something like $installdir (used below).

`--node-modules=$installdir/usr/share/vscode/`: This would install node modules to a `node_module` folder in `/usr/share/vscode`. This keeps it isolated from any `npm` or `nodejs` system packages and files. Atom does something similar, with installing things to (_for example_) `/usr/share/atom/resources/...`

124644791,Universal Language Injections,"Language injections is a feature of IDEs like Webstorm and PHPStorm that auto-detects when a language is use inside another language and then shows syntax highlighting for that _injected_ language. VS Code currently supports this in a few places:
- `<style>` tags in HTML get CSS highlighting and IntelliSense
- `<script>` tags in HTML get JS highlighting and IntelliSense
- HTML in a PHP file outside of `<?php ?>` gets highlighting but no IntelliSense

But there are many other contexts where this would be helpful, that are currently not supported and impossible to all hardcode:
- `style` attribute in HTML contain CSS
- String literals in languages like PHP often contain SQL, see #1361. PHPStorm supports this for PHP, but Webstorm for example does not support this for NodeJS. It should really be supported in any language.
- String literals commonly contain HTML in Javascript or PHP (e.g. with jQuery, Angular or Vue templates)
- String literals commonly contain GraphQL queries in JavaScript
- HTML event attributes contain Javascript, like `onclick=""event.preventDefault()""`
- Countless HTML attributes in the Angular framework have Javascript-like expressions in them, like `ng-if=""ctrl.items.length > 0 && someOtherValue""`, but also the mustache syntax `{{ ... }}`.
- `<script type=""text/ng-template"">` contain Angular templates which is nothing but HTML. This pattern of templates in script tags exists in many of the major client side MVC frameworks.
- Javascript has RegExp literals. In other languages like PHP, RegExps are passed as strings. This is also the case in tasks.json problem matchers for VS Code (RegExp inside JSON string)

All of these examples currently don't get colored and receive no autocompletion. It would be awesome if VS Code was able to automatically detect languages in any context (like string literals, HTML attributes and tags) by some language patterns, like `< >` tags for HTML/XML, keywords like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, etc. for SQL or template string tags like `gql` for GraphQL.

124869781,Proposal: Usability Improvement Suggestions,"The approach of maintaining a task using two different files seems more pain than necessary to me. May I suggest a few improvements to the way projects are administered in VS Code:
<br/>
### Add `npm install` context menu to package.json file

When cloning a project from GitHub or after editing the `package.json` file in VS Code, no Node module is getting downloaded. So currently it's required to leave VS Code and execute `npm install` in a command prompt.

I suggest to add a context menu item to the Explorer when a `package.json` file is selected to simplify this task. The context menu item is suggested to run `npm install` from the directory of the `package.json` file:

![package](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9283914/12097398/d07d5402-b31b-11e5-961a-c3cb0e03769d.png)
<br/>
### Use `pragma comment` for running tasks in VS Code:

Maintaining two distinct files to have tasks get run in VS Code seems more administration pain than necessary.

I suggest to support a pragma comment preceding a task, fulfilling the same purpose as the `tasks.json` file does:

``` javascript
var gulp = require(""gulp"");
var ts = require(""gulp-typescript"");

//# task { isShellCommand: true, isWatching: true, problemMatcher: ""$tsc"" }
gulp.task(""tsc"", function () { gulp.src().pipe(ts).pipe(gulp.dest()); })
```

(The `tasks.json` file may still be applied, e.g. for legacy/compatibility purposes or if a complex task configuration needs to be set. If both, a `# task` pragma comment and an entry in the `tasks.json` file existed for a task, any of the two definitions would prevail.)

<br/>
### Add `Run Task` context menu to any `.js` file containing a `# task` pragma comment

Currently, running a task requires much typing.

I suggest to add a context menu to Explorer for any `.js` file containing a `# task` pragma comment so tasks can easily be browsed for and a task can simply be started by two clicks:

![run task](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9283914/12098333/f1cc0666-b321-11e5-8f50-cfc10fae09db.png)

The tasks in the list should be alphabetically sorted and the first task name letter should be used for the mnemonic, so starting a task could be as easy as `CTXT, T, L` for ""less"" or `CTXT, T, T` for ""tsc"" in the above screen shot.
<br/>
### Add option to automatically start tasks

Whenever a project is opened in VS Code, which is indicated by the following preconditions:
- a folder gets opened which contains one or more `.js` files
- any of those `.js` files contains one or more `# task` pragma comments
- any of those `# task` pragma comments comes with an `autoStart: true` property set

... then the tasks marked with `autoStart: true` should automatically be executed.

Here's a screenshot depicting how the `autoStart: true` property is suggested to be applied:

<br/>
Browsing for the `//# task` pragma comment in all `.js` files within the current project root folder might become time consuming, given that there may be many large `.js` files in the project folder. So browsing should be performed asynchronously.
<br/>
#### The following behaviour is suggested:
1. Browsing `.js` files in the current project root folder for containing `//# task { autoStart: true [, ...]}` should be performed asynchronously after the folder has been opened in Code.
2. A user/workspace setting should be introduced to control whether the confirmation dialog box should be displayed and whether automatic execution of tasks should be performed anyway. The setting should come with the following enumeration:
   - `always`  // always run autostart tasks without showing the confirmation dialog box
   - `confirm`  // as soon as the first `//# task { autoStart: true [, ...] }` pragma comment is parsed by the browser after the folder has been opened in Code, a confirmation dialog is getting displayed to the user. Depending on user selection, any autostart task found in the folder will be getting executed - or none.
   - `never`  // never run autostart tasks
3. Autostart tasks should be run for each file containing one or more `//# task { autoStart: true [, ...] }` pragma comments separately. Tasks defined in different task runners won't depend on each other.
   <br/>
   _(The screenshot montage above mentions the text ""Do you want to run the autostart tasks stored in gulpfile.js"". This text is only a suggested visualization. Mentioning a file name in the text is actually not correct when there is more than one single task runner file about to be scanned and executed, which is the suggested behaviour.)_

<br/>
There is a `--pretty` option for TypeScript, but AFAIK it doesn't show any effect when applying it using `gulp-typescript` or other task runner plug-ins.

So I'd like to suggest to support colored messages in Output window.
<br/>
VS Code may be ""skinned"", or, ""themed"", which may cause interference with colored Output text. So if you decide to implement colored Output text I suggest to change Output colors like the following if their respective brightness will be getting too close to the Output panel's background color brightness:

``` javascript
/** Class definition for RGB color.
  */
class Rgb
{
  constructor( public r: number
             , public g: number
             , public b: number
             , public name: string
             );

  get isBright() : boolean { return r + g + b > 348; }
  get isDark() : boolean { return !isBright(); }

  /** converts blue <=> darkblue; red <=> darkred; white <=> black, etc. */
  function inverseLuminance() : Rgb { ...; return this; }
}



/** Function used by the Output panel for setting the panel's text color.
  * @param textColor - Text color requested by task runner for output.
  * @param bgColor - Output panel background color.
  */
function getTextColor(textColor: Rgb, bgColor: Rgb) : Rgb
{
  // If the brightness of the desired color is too close to the brightness
  // of the Output panel's background color, inverse the desired color's
  // luminance, i.e. switch from yellow to darkyellow etc.
  if (Math.abs((textColor.r + textColor.g + textColor.b)
     - (bgColor.r + bgColor.g + bgColor.b)) < 30
     )
  {
    return textColor.inverseLuminance();
  }

  return textColor;
}

```

<br/>
This will result in considerably better legible output messages:

""<cursor_here>""

// type back-tick (es6 template string), no auto-filled closing back-tick

window has the showTextDocument with an argument to indicate the column. This can be used when the new document is still not opened, but if the target document is already opened, you have no way to know in which column.

*Just changing Language Mode (cmd+K M) doesn't work because intellisense for modular systems need to know where file will be saved.

125793200,[css] Consider stylelint for CSS linting,"I was trying out Visual Studio recently and realized that it uses CSS Lint. As one of the creators of [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint), I am writing to ask you to consider adding stylelint support, so Visual Studio users can take advantage of a more robust and active CSS linter. 

CSSLint was good for its time, but is limited and pretty much stagnant. With stylelint, we're trying to create a newer and better tool. stylelint is actively growing and very actively maintained; it is powered by [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), a tool & ecosystem that is blowing up right now; and it has adopted many fantastic features from ESLint, like plugins, shareable configs, and custom reporters.  Because styelint uses PostCSS for parsing, it can handle any syntax that PostCSS can, which currently includes SCSS and potentially includes anything else, like Less and Stylus (when people build the parsers for them).

Please let me know if you have any questions about stylelint. Feedback on the project would also be appreciated. Thanks for your consideration.

And please let me know if I should instead file this issue with [WebAnalyzer](https://github.com/madskristensen/WebAnalyzer) — I wasn't sure which project was the right one to ask.

125796501,Git stashing,"I often need to switch branches while still having some launch.json file silightly modified etc. Currently, I now either have to clean the changes before I can switch branches or have to open a terminal instead (which breaks the workflow) and type `git stash`, `git checkout`, `git stash pop`. It would be nice if Code had buttons for stashing, either next to ""Clean All"" (""Stash""), or in the ""..."" menu. The ""..."" menu should have a ""Pop"" submenu, that expands to all listed stashs with their messages to instantly apply them. Stashing in git is great because it's nothing but a quick stack to put temporary changes while doing stuff like checking out another branch.

125950031,Multi-line diagnostics,"Some error messages (e.g. from Elm) are quite verbose, and are very hard to read properly without line breaks.

Therefore it would be nice if the `vscode.Diagnostic` message could contain line breaks (these could be stripped out in the `Errors and warnings` selector to keep the UI sensible).  It would be even nicer still if error messages could contain colors and styles.

This is an example of the kind of thing it would be nice to have in a diagnostic popup:

126008756,AutoHotkey (Windows)/Keyboard Maestro (OS X) text replacements don't work in Visual Studio Code,"I have the exact same issue with AutoHotkey in Windows and Keyboard Maestro in OS X:

I have a setup where **btw** is automatically replaced with **by the way**.

In every application I have tested, except VSCode, this works. Every time I type **btw**, these three characters are deleted and **by the way** inserted instead. In VSCode the three characters are deleted, but **by the way** is never inserted.

I'm no expert on text replacement apps, but I think the text replacements apps work by simulating three presses on the backspace key, then simulating a press on each character key in **by the way** or by adding **by the way** to the clipboard and then pasting it into the active window.

If you want to recreate the bug, try the following AutoHotkey file:

```
:?*:btw::by the way
