Chat subagent UX,"Today subagents are run synchronously (the orchestrator agent is blocked until they are complete) and not in parallel (if it starts multiple subagents via parallel tool calls, they are run one at a time).

The goal for this month is to run sync subagents in parallel and to have decent UX for this. We can brainstorm about subagents that are spawned in the background and do not block the main agent, but I think it's a much more complex scenario.

Run subagents in parallel: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274630

For a subagent, I would like to see
- The name of the custom agent being used (if applicable)
- The task description for the subagent (shown today, with a spinner)
- Something about what the subagent is currently working on
- The final text that the subagent returned (not by default, but on a click or something)

And I think I'd like to see this for all subagents currently running in parallel

Some things to consider
- How are tool confirmations shown for the individual subagent?
- Do we need to ensure that the user will always see confirmations in the viewport, even when there are several subagents and a short viewport?
- How much of the subagent's history do I see? Just the latest tool or more?
- Do we call them subagents, agents (overloaded), something else?
- Special handling for edits?

The simplest possible thing that comes to mind is something like the thinking blocks we have today.
- The title shows the custom agent name (if set, or just 'subagent') and the task description
- In the box we only show the current tool. One can click to expand.
- We don't show the thinking text, at least for now.
- When you expand a finished subagent, you also see the final text returned to the orchestrator.
- Confirmations show inside the box

<img width=""491"" height=""101"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd7c62a8-2d63-493e-9c74-ba9d50f1bc39"" />

<img width=""486"" height=""93"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06cabec7-c0e6-45cf-9f34-fdaf1b617988"" />

Some other things to think about, tying this to other explorations from Joanna
- Should we pull confirmations out of the individual subagent box and show them next to the input? For all tool confirmations, not just for subagents?
  - In this case, need a way to know which subagent the confirmation belongs to, maybe click a button to reveal
- Should there be a more structured output for subagents, eg showing the individual edits that came from the subagent?
- Can we associate TODOs and subagents, to show the chat response trajectory in a more structured way?
  - I'm not sure we can really do this today, I think that an agent trajectory is sometimes less linear than its TODOs suggest
  - But let's keep it in mind if we get TODOs rendering like this
- What is the fundamental difference between subagent orchestration and multi-agent orchestration? Is there a world where we render them more similarly?
- If we develop better UI for background terminals, think about whether background subagents should be shown in a similar way

### Summary
Replace VS Code's Simple Browser with an integrated browser that supports AI-assisted web development workflows. Users can visually select DOM elements, capture screenshots, and export context (HTML, CSS, error logs) directly to AI tools for debugging, modification, and implementation assistance.Context/Background


### Developers frequently need to:
- Inspect live web pages and communicate specific elements to AI assistants
- Debug rendering issues and share visual + code context efficiently
- Iterate on UI changes with AI by providing precise element selection
- Switch between internal preview and external browser testing

Without integrated selection and context export, developers resort to manual copying of HTML, taking separate screenshots, and describing elements verbally—a slow, error-prone process that breaks flow.

### Description
Build an integrated browser extension for VS Code that maintains all Simple Browser functionality:

Core Capabilities (Simple Browser Parity)
- Launch browser via command palette, editor context menu, and custom UI
- Navigate to any external URL with address bar
- Open current page in external browser (Chrome, Edge, default system browser)
- Element Selection
  - Element Selection Mode: Click to select DOM elements, with visual highlighting
  - Multi-element Selection: Hold modifier key (Ctrl/Cmd) to select multiple elements or maybe it is always continuous with no need to use a key.
  - Context Export: Selected elements export as structured context including may include code and screenshots
  - On hover show element details (default Chrome popover)
- Ability to update settings
- Open browser content in standalone VS Code window (detached view)

New:
- Ability to open more than one browser instance at a time (on Simple Browser, it's limited to a single instance)
- When in its own window have a simple way to send a prompt to the the main prompt area
- Toggle Browser Developer Tools
- Create a setting to choose between the old and new browser experiences, this setting will be used to drive the rollout
- Allow the browser to remember the last URL that was loaded into the browser
- Ability to open links from chat output

Out of scope:
- Select an area of the browser canvas to take a screenshot of
- Testing responsiveness based on predetermined browser sizes
- When an error, have one click ability to send logs as context
- Create a null state for when the integrated browser get launched
- Bookmark URLs to help with forgetting what port things are on

Today VSCode cleans up the chat history of GH Copilot every time that it gets restarted, once this happens the user sees a list of the historic sessions in case the user wants to resume the work from one of them.

VSCode might consider a similar approach for sessions that have been inactive for a long period of time, and when using agent mode when their finished without an stop reason.

Why? The user might have already finished the work that was doing and after a period of time might resume the work picking a different task where the current chat history is unrelated to it.

Today as a developer and user of VSCode I have to manually restart the session, making a click to the + icon, two or three times a day. Wondering how many users are missing to do so and they are starting new work by polluting the context with the previous work. 

We might consider on showing a pop up with a clear ask about if the user wants to continue with the current session or wants to start a new one rather than eagerly start a new one. This would still allow users that want to keep using the same session  to do so without having to go through the history chat list

"Add a way to attach output to a test, without it being added to the main test run output.","When running tests, there is the main output panel for the test run, and each test has an output panel.

Possible duplicate, but the server is just waiting for `textDocument/formatting`:  https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/238935

my extension want to use the following code:

```ts
// This list is not used as-is for implementation to determine whether formatting processing is possible.
    const supportedExtensions = [
      ""json""
       // ... other extension
    ];

    const clientOptions: LanguageClientOptions = {
      // Register the server for plain text documents
      documentSelector: [
        {
          pattern: `**/*.{${supportedExtensions.join("","")}}`,
          scheme: ""file"",
        },
      ],
      ...
  }
```
I tried with a new `documentSelector` on `clientOptions`. With `{language: ""json""}` too, same bug.

When the server is started, VS Code will send, for every package.json in the project, a `textDocument/didOpen` and `textDocument/didClose` notification to the server. Even if you have only a TypeScript file open.
With a big project, this can send over 100 requests to the server.
Without `json`, the server is just waiting, after dynamic registrations, for the formatting request.

Try it yourself with the oxc [git pull request](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/17615) and these settings.


```
{
  ""oxc.trace.server"": ""verbose"",
  ""oxc.path.oxfmt"": ""apps/oxfmt/dist/cli.js"", // debug with local oxfmt build
  ""oxc.fmt.configPath"": ""oxfmtrc.jsonc"",
  ""editor.defaultFormatter"": ""oxc.oxc-vscode"",
  ""editor.formatOnSave"": true
}
```

You need to rebase, execute these commands and restart the editor after it:
```
cd editors/vscode
pnpm install
pnpm oxfmt:build:debug
pnpm compile
pnpm package
pnpm install-extension
```

These are my export from the output channel:  [Oxc (Fmt).log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24479397/Oxc.Fmt.log), after some minutes these will happend again (without doing something): [Oxc (Fmt)2.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24479448/Oxc.Fmt.2.log)

- VS Code Version: 1.107.1
- OS Version: 25H2 client; 24H2 server

Setup: remote machine is running Windows 11 24H2 with OpenSSH server and has pwsh set as the SSH default shell (e.g. when I SSH into the machine, I get an instance of pwsh).

Not sure if that plays a role, but my client machine does not have native IPv6 connectivity, and I am using Yggdrasil to connect to the server by its AAAA host record with Yggdrasil address. I noticed that some programs randomly fail to resolve IPv6 address in question presumably due to machine having no regular access to IPv6. But that issue goes away by retrying whereas the one below reproduces 100% of time.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. On the client: select any recent folder you've opened via SSH either via VS Code task list in the Taskbar or in a new local (not connected via SSH) VS Code window recent folders list.
2. At this point VS Code presents me with ""Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?"" dialog even though I've used this folder and answered ""Trust Folder & Continue"" before (see further). If I press ""Trust Folder & Continue"" now, it fails to connect: 'Could not establish connection to ""xxx"": Connecting with SSH timed out.' If instead I press ""Cancel"", VS Code connects to the remote, opens folder, then presents the ""Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?"" AGAIN. Now if I press ""Trust Folder & Continue"", I can proceed to editing normally (in trusted mode), ""Cancel"" also works in untrusted mode.",bug,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/286384

# VS Code Feature Request: Control Tree Item Expansion During Drag Operations

## Problem

When implementing drag-and-drop in `TreeViews` with hierarchical structures (folders + leaf items), VS Code automatically expands any collapsible tree item when hovering over it during a drag operation. This behavior is hardcoded and cannot be controlled by extensions.

**Real-world scenario**: We're building a connection management tree with folders and connection items. Connections are expandable (they contain databases), but resolving the children requires establishing a real network connection.

During drag-and-drop operations, when a user moves the mouse pointer *over* a connection item to reach a target folder, VS Code forcibly expands the item. **This automatically triggers an unwanted connection attempt**, blocking the UI or causing side effects, even though the user simply wanted to pass over the item.

This behavior makes drag-and-drop functionality essentially unusable for our scenario, as we cannot allow accidental connections during simple UI interactions. It strictly limits the extensibility of `TreeView` for any extension that uses ""virtual nodes"" -- items that are expandable but aren't simple folders, or require expensive operations to resolve children.

The current behavior assumes that expandable items are **always** valid drop containers, but this isn't true for many hierarchical models where:
- Leaf items can have children for viewing purposes but shouldn't accept drops
- The distinction between ""drop onto parent folder"" vs ""drop into subfolder"" matters
- Visual feedback and user intent need to be distinguished

## Impact

This limitation forces us to **disable drag-and-drop entirely** in our scenario to prevent poor user experience and accidental operations.

## Proposed Solution

We need a way to control the hover-expansion behavior programmatically. This could be achieved by:

1.  **A property on `TreeItem`** (e.g., `expandOnDragOver: boolean`) to explicitly opt-out of auto-expansion for specific items.
2.  **A callback in `TreeDragAndDropController`** (e.g., `handleDragOver`) that allows the extension to determine if expansion is allowed for a given target.

Either approach would solve the issue by giving extensions control over when an item should be expanded during user interaction.

VS Code’s Disassembly View fails to display function symbols inline even though the debugger backend provides them.

The ""symbol"": ""_main"" field is present, but VS Code shows only raw instructions — no symbol label above the address.

Agent sessions: Clear “Undo Archive” Action,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

Description
After archiving an item, it’s not obvious that the action can be undone. While it is possible to restore archived items by filtering to show archived content, this workflow is not clear or discoverable for many users.

Suggestion
Add a clear “Undo Archive” button or inline action immediately after an item is archived, so users can easily reverse the action without needing to change filters.

Benefit
Improves discoverability, reduces confusion, and makes archiving feel safer and more user-friendly.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

The `editor.fontSize` setting supports decimal values (e.g., `11.25`, `13.5`), but `terminal.integrated.fontSize` only accepts whole numbers. Setting a decimal value like `11.25` gets truncated to `11`.

**Current Behavior**

```json
{
  ""editor.fontSize"": 11.25,
  ""terminal.integrated.fontSize"": 11.25
}
```
The editor renders at 11.25px, but the terminal gets truncated to 11px.

**Expected Behavior**

`terminal.integrated.fontSize` should support decimal values just like `editor.fontSize`.

**Use Case**

Sometimes the difference between `11` and `12` is too significant. A value like `11.5` would provide better fine-tuning for readability, especially on high-DPI displays.

**Notes**
- The setting schema already defines `type: 'number'` (not `'integer'`)
- xterm.js (the terminal renderer) already supports floating-point font sizes

Copilot instructions and agents.md files should not auto-load linked markdown files,"When using copilot-instructions.md or AGENTS.md files in a workspace, markdown files that are linked within these instruction files are automatically being loaded and included as context. This behavior was meant for pre-agentic flows, and now can lead to unintended context bloat and unexpected behavior when these files simply reference other documentation without intending to include them as active context.

Fish run recent command messed up when commands ran with Copilot,"Testing #286022

This one is interesting

Set `  ""chat.tools.terminal.preventShellHistory"": false` then use fish shell.

How to repro (see the video too):
1. Run some command to run in terminal via copilot
2. Look at run recent command. It is fine
3. Run second command to run in terminal via copilot
4. 🐛 Run recent command polluted with `welcome to fish...etc`

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe99a934-0a29-45a4-98ab-28f0fd96986b

The interesting thing is that when commands are ran manually run recent command is NOT polluted:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70508c59-c266-4cac-bfff-24608599e687

Im not sure what the difference is between running command manually vs. via copilot, but surprised run recent command behaves differently.

Casing transforms in snippets only support Latin characters,"Testing #233798

Use the following snippet:
```
""testSnippet"": {
  ""scope"": ""javascript,typescript"",
  ""prefix"": ""testSnippet"",
  ""body"": ""${1} -> ${1/(.*)/${1:/upcase} ${1:/downcase} ${1:/camelcase} ${1:/pascalcase} ${1:/kebabcase} ${1:/snakecase}/}""
}
```

Give it input `oneTwo` you will get ```oneTwo -> ONETWO onetwo oneTwo OneTwo one-two one_two``` which is correct.
Give it input `одинДва` you will get ```одинДва -> ОДИНДВА одиндва одинДва одинДва одинДва одиндва``` which is incorrect as non-Latin letters are not handled correctly (in this case Russian alphabet, but code only cares about a-z).

We should probably use Unicode definition of words if possible to perform the case transforms.

This used to work and allowed jumping directly to the file and line.

Ctrl+Click should open the file in the editor at the correct line.

### **Actual**

Nothing happens when clicking the file link.

When I was using Agent to validate my apps via mcp tools, it often captured screenshots and they were really great artifacts for me to review the intermediate steps. Right now I could hover on the image pills in the chat response but it would so much nicer if I can open them in a custom editor to browse them all.

Agent sessions: creating new background session is lagging,"Originally reported here https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/281913

* Creating worktree and the like can be slow, while all of this is happening we don't have a new session in the sessions list

**Slow points**
* Creating worktree
* Possibly even starting a new session (this depends on how fast the CLI is, if we spawn a process in future this could be slower)
* Getting list of sessions and session details for each session could be slow
(we might want to add telemetry for this and cache some of this in memory)
E.g. if user starts a new session, then nothing has changed in the list of session, except to include a new item and return previously returned items

**Solutions**
* List current session in list of sessions and trigger session changed event
* However this has a drawback, `we dont' have a session id`
If we use the new untitled session id and return that in the session list, then this needs to be swapped as well.
I suppose this is fine as thats how the UI works today

**Summary**
* We might as well always list a new session in the sessions list using the `untitled session id`
(except in cases where we have worktree change migration etc, as in those cases we start a new session)

Support exportable artifacts selection UI for chat session export,"We need to introduce a UI widget where users can select exportable artifacts via checkboxes so that what is exported is a zip package including all selections.

Terminal gets blocked on false detection of input needed from script that finished,"Have the agent run this script

```
#!/bin/bash

sleep 1
echo ""Press A to continue...""
read -n 1 -s key
echo ""You pressed: $key""
echo ""Continuing...""
sleep 1

echo ""Press B to continue...""
# read -n 1 -s key2
# echo ""You pressed: $key2""
echo ""Continuing...""
```

It detects the first input request and handles it. Then the script exits, but it keeps waiting and picks up the second message incorrectly. Then I'm stuck in an infinite loop of giving input which just goes to the shell (which is possibly dangerous because i'm running commands unexpectedly).

I got into this situation originally because the agent kept failing to write this script properly (the script above with those lines uncommented would be incorrect). But it's easy to imagine real scenarios that get a false positive for detecting an input request. In any case we shouldn't be waiting around when we know that the script finished.

Also this seems to only repro when the terminal is not visible? Or it's a bit random. But I can hit it quite consistently.",bug,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/286014

Override ApplicationInsights proxy support,"ApplicationInsights proxy support interferes with VS Code's proxy support.

---

Issue: Copilot telemetry is not making its way to GitHub for machines which have an env variable called `http_proxy`, even if that env variable is defined correctly. This is caused by [ApplicationInsights](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-node.js/blob/20fbcb87ff9c361cf5fdfe0e500f857c7c813373/Library/Util.ts#L321) proxy support which interferes with the builtin VS Code's proxy support.

---

Verification:

Run local proxy:
```sh
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:3128:3128 --name proxy ubuntu/squid:latest
docker exec proxy tail -F /var/log/squid/access.log
```

Run VS Code with env variables:
```sh
# Bash
http_proxy=http://localhost:3128 https_proxy=http://localhost:3128 code
# PowerShell
$env:http_proxy=""http://localhost:3128""; $env:https_proxy=""http://localhost:3128""; code; Remove-Item Env:\http_proxy,Env:\https_proxy
```

Verify that the proxy logs for `copilot-telemetry.githubusercontent.com` show status `TCP_TUNNEL` and not `TCP_MISS_ABORTED`.

"Invalid path separators used cause ""editing outside the workspace"" which is incorrect","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

- Copilot Chat Extension Version:
- VS Code Version: v1.107
- OS Version: Windows 11
- Feature (e.g. agent/edit/ask mode): agent
- Selected model (e.g. GPT 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet): different models
- Logs: [at_the_start_i_see_the_logs_below__but_do_not_get__logs.chatreplay.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24439888/at_the_start_i_see_the_logs_below__but_do_not_get__logs.chatreplay.json)

## Description
I quite often get some confusion from Copilot that it thinks it is editing files outside of my workspace, where it is not. I then have to approve every file edit, which is not helpful.  
- Even a ""reload window"" does not help. I think I have seen this behavior now in different models as well.
- Rebooting VS Code does not help when going back to the same session
- Rebooting and starting a new session also does not work

I did notice this on the panel:

Which is odd, since it should be a full windows path: `c:\users\RobBos\....`

Feature Request: Open Integrated Terminal at Current File Location from Editor Context Menu,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

## 📌 Summary

Add a new option in the editor (code canvas) right-click context menu to open the integrated terminal at the currently active file's directory.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In VS Code today:

* The editor (main code area) context menu does not provide any way to open a terminal
* Developers must:
  1. Switch to Explorer
  2. Find the file or folder
  3. Right-click → Open in Terminal or
  4. Manually `cd` inside the terminal

This breaks flow when working primarily from the editor.

## ✅ Proposed Solution

Add a context-menu item when right-clicking inside an open file in the editor:

**🖥️ Open Integrated Terminal Here**

**Behavior:**

* Opens the integrated terminal
* Sets the working directory to the parent directory of the currently active file
* If no terminal exists, create one
* If terminal exists, reuse or focus it (consistent with current behavior)

## 🔄 Expected Behavior

1. Open any file in the editor
2. Right-click anywhere in the code canvas
3. Select ""Open Integrated Terminal Here""
4. Terminal opens at:
```bash
<directory_of_active_file>
```

## 📐 UX & Edge Cases

* Menu option appears only when a file-backed editor is active
* Hidden for:
  * Untitled editors
  * Read-only virtual documents (unless supported)
* Should respect:
  * Default terminal profile
  * Workspace vs global terminal behavior

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes (Optional)

* Resolve path via the active editor's `URI`
* Use existing terminal service APIs
* Similar logic already exists for folder-based terminal actions
* Command should be reusable for future extensions

## 🌟 Why This Feature Is Valuable

* Keeps developers focused in the editor
* Saves multiple clicks per workflow
* Especially useful in monorepos & deeply nested structures
* Aligns with VS Code's productivity-first UX",feature-request,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285976

Ask user tool for github copilot,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
## Summary
Add an `Ask` tool that lets an agent ask the user a question mid-workflow and **wait** for the reply as a *pause/resume* operation (not a termination), keeping context and orchestration intact.

## Problem
When an agent needs clarification, the current interaction pattern often turns into a “stop and ask” break in execution. This creates a few practical problems:
1. **Workflow continuity breaks**: The system behaves as if the run ended, rather than as a step that is waiting for input. This could become an issue if automatic handoffs or other automation are added.
2. **Less interaction with the user**: To ask for clarifications or simple confirmations, the agent has to stop while it’s working. That may be discouraged by training, biases, or system prompts, which reduces collaboration with the user.
3. **Context gets muddy**: Stopping for user interaction can clutter the context and lead to duplicated or unnecessary information because of how the chat system works.

## Proposal
Introduce an `Ask` tool with semantics similar to waiting on a sub-agent:
- The agent sends a message/query to the user.
- The run enters a **waiting state**.
- The user receives the message in chat, with some agent-related buttons disabled and a clear indicator that the agent is paused (not stopped).
- When the user responds, the run resumes from the same step, with the reply attached as structured input.

## Benefits
- More agent–user interaction, improving output by aligning better with user intent.
- Better safety by letting the agent pause for confirmation before making significant changes.
- A smoother workflow by only pausing when necessary.

## Future opportunities
This tool enables more autonomous workflows where agents involve the user only when needed by requesting missing information or waiting for confirmation before important steps.

Feature Request: Inline display of console.log output next to source code during debugging,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

### Problem

When debugging JavaScript/TypeScript applications in VS Code, `console.log` output is only available in the Debug Console or Terminal.

For workflows that involve frequent logging, this forces constant context switching between:
- source code
- Debug Console

This significantly breaks reading flow, especially when debugging logic-heavy or asynchronous code.

### Proposed Feature

Add an optional feature to display `console.log` output inline next to the source line that produced it, similar to:

```js
console.log('hello') // hello

Workbench hover appears when focused after quick pick closes,"
Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

When clicking on a status bar item to open a QuickPick menu and performing an action, the tooltip for that status bar item unexpectedly appears. This behavior occurs across multiple extensions, suggesting it's a VS Code core issue rather than extension-specific. The tooltip should only display on hover, not during QuickPick interactions, to avoid disrupting the user experience and potentially obscuring the QuickPick interface. Consider modifying the status bar interaction logic to suppress tooltip display during active QuickPick operations.

Currently the plus button creates a new session and keeps the current one running in the background. But `/clear` is an explicit action to clear content, so it should archive the current session rather than just pushing it to the background IMHO.

When chat view and session list view are side by side, archiving the active session from the list makes the item disappear from the list, but the chat view still shows the archived session content. More natural behavior would be to clear the chat view when the session is archived.

Typical workflow:

- Start a new session to run an end to end testing with MCP tools
- When it finishes and passes, I'll hit the archive button to move on to new task
- The chat view is then cleared (expected behavior)",feature-request,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285853
Allow writing prompt with voice when session is in progress,"When a chat session is running, the voice/mic button gets disabled but the text input box stays enabled.

Inconsistent Naming: Voice vs Dictation,"Voice related commands currently use inconsistent terminology across different components, making features hard to discover.

Current state:
- Chat commands use ""Voice"": ""Chat: Inline Voice Chat"", ""Chat: Quick Voice Chat"", etc.

As a user I would search for Voice as that's what the hover of the mic button teaches me.

Surface pinned editor state on hover when navigating files via Explorer,"### What this PR does

VS Code clearly indicates pinned files in the editor tab strip, where pinned tabs are visually distinct and ordered predictably. This works well while working within the editor area.

However, when navigating files primarily through the Explorer, the pinned state of a file that is already open in an editor group is not visible at all.

- When a file is pinned in the editor:
- The pinned state is visible only in the editor tab
- The same file, when viewed in the Explorer, appears identical to any other file

There is no way to tell (even on hover) that this file is already pinned and acting as a stable editor tab

This creates a disconnect between the editor and the Explorer, especially when users rely on the sidebar for navigation.

Would it be reasonable to surface the pinned state only on hover in the Explorer, without adding persistent icons or changing layout?

### For example:

On hovering a file in the Explorer that is currently pinned in an editor group
Show a subtle hover indication such as:
A tooltip: “Pinned”
This keeps the Explorer visually unchanged by default while making pinned state discoverable during navigation.


### Visual reference

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/682a883b-4184-4d11-8b01-d7a8d8364c53)

If this sounds reasonable, I’m happy to try implementing it.

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
### Feature Request

In the Git: Checkout to... QuickPick, it would be very useful to be able to pin or visually distinguish important branches such as `main`, `develop`, or long-living release branches.

### Problem
In repositories with many branches, important branches get lost in the list. Users frequently need to scroll or search for `main` / `develop`, even though these branches are used constantly.

### Proposed Solution
- Allow pinning/favoriting branches so they always appear at the top
- Allow simple visual distinction (icon, color, or group header)

### Why this matters
This would significantly improve daily workflow for users working with many branches and aligns with features available in other popular IDEs.

Exclude extensions with auto updates disabled from available updates on badge,"<!-- ⚠️⚠️ Do Not Delete This! feature_request_template ⚠️⚠️ -->
<!-- Please read our Rules of Conduct: https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ -->
<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

**Short description**
Introduce a setting to suppress including extensions which have updates available **AND** automatic updates disabled from the badge on the _Extensions_ icon in the _Activity Bar_ which shows the number of available updates.

**Full description**
When there are updates available for installed extensions VS Code displays a badge on the _Extensions_ icon in the _Activity Bar_ with the number of extensions with pending updates. Usually this is a helpful visual indicator but it can have the opposite effect for extensions which have had automatic updates disabled. In this scenario, it's common that all extensions are up-to-date except for those that have been deliberately opted-out (i.e. the badge is showing just the number of extensions with automatic updates disabled which have available updates).

This issue is to request the addition of a setting which allows for excluding extensions with automatic updates disabled from the calculation of the number of extensions with pending updates shown as a badge on the _Extensions_ icon. Note this only pertains to the badge; available updates for all extensions, including those with automatic updates disabled, would still be shown as usual when the _Extensions_ pane is focused.

**Rationale**
A common reason for disabling automatic updates for an extension is due to a serious bug in a newer version which would break important functionality. Another still is that broader changes to the workspace are required before the extension can be updated. In these scenarios, the available updates badge only serves as an annoying distraction as the updates can't (or shouldn't) be performed.",feature-request,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285779

GitHub Copilot restore still shows modifications and breaks on accept,"1. Request that the LLM modify multiple files and add files as well.
2. Ask the LLM some follow-up questions.
3. Restore the checkpoint on the line before step 1 above.

The files will be reset, the later chat conversation will be removed, and the text of prompt 1 above will be placed in the current prompt input field.

**Issue 1:** The modified files still have their modified symbol (a filled circle) in their tabs, with the option to ""Keep"" or ""Undo"". They were reset—there should be nothing to keep or undo. (This confusing part is related to the #282069, which is similarly confusing.)

4. Go to the chat prompt in the side panel and erase the current prompt input field that was filled.
5. Hit `<Ctrl+Enter>` to accept all the ""changes"" (even though there are no real changes at this point).

**Expected:** The modified symbol disappears from the tabs.

**Issue 2**: A notification ""Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')"" appears in the bottom, right-hand corner of the screen.
